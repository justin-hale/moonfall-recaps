Inside, she finds a set of color-coded journals authored by her grandson George, who was last known to be working with the Twilight Company. George’s notes detail a mysterious operation called Project Purple Patch, feuds among High Forge’s underground gangs, and a religious mission involving Father Jacob and Mother Asuka. George was last seen heading north on a pilgrimage tied to the Church of Tyr. Olivia finds a lead in the journals pointing toward a halfling named Finnegan, an information broker who has interfaced with both Twilight Company and the gang Iron Claws. Reuniting the Crew # Silas, Red, and Olivia reconvene at a garage after a period of scattered rest. The party shares updates: Red reveals a Twilight Company hit order against “Healing Touch” — his parents — marked with a certified stamp. Silas confirms the order looks official, despite the Twilight Company not typically engaging in contract killings. The group decides to dig deeper into the Twilight Company’s network and determine how and why Red’s parents were targeted. A Trip to the Cathedral # The trio visits the Cathedral of Tyr, which doubles as a courthouse and jail. Red grapples with the revelation that his pacifist beliefs may have been sheltered from the harsher doctrines of Tyr’s justice. Olivia secures a sealed letter of authority from the bishop, sanctioning her to investigate George’s disappearance on the Church\u0026rsquo;s behalf. The Twilight Company Meeting # The group attends an open Twilight Company meeting held under a bar called the Little Hobble. Silas, under the alias Martin Birchwood, marks himself as a member using Thieves’ Cant to gain deeper access. Jobs listed at the meeting include car sabotage, political canvassing, artifact theft, and scouting missions — but no hit jobs, confirming the rarity of Red’s note. Olivia speaks with leaders including Cyrus, Rekha (tiefling), and Vector (dwarf), learning George last checked in from Lonnie’s Bar \u0026amp; Grill in Milstrom, en route to a shrine in the mountains. Key Intel # Project Purple Patch appears compromised; Finnegan is on a mission to investigate, meeting someone called Lady Viper. Twilight Company’s hierarchy includes an inner circle; Olivia and Red are identified by name and purpose by members, especially the observant Rekha. Silas eavesdrops on internal discussions, learning about Twilight’s role in manipulating High Forge politics and counterbalancing the Iron Claws. Rekha seems especially astute and potentially suspicious of the group. Next Steps # Travel to Milstrom to follow George’s trail from Lonnie’s. Consider pursuing sabotage missions to support Elspeth’s race effort. Uncover more about Finnegan, the Night Boys, and the true aim of Project Purple Patch. Party Status # Olivia: Acting on church orders, equipped with official writ. Silas: Embedded in Twilight ranks under an alias. Red: Struggling with identity, loss, and implications of divine justice. Next Session: Prepping for the trip to Milstrom, potential infiltration or deeper involvement in Twilight internal affairs.

Foreigners are generally restricted to the Market Ward unless they have paperwork or sponsorship. The Market Ward is full of inns, traders, bars, and entertainment venues—and hosts the city’s underground racing scene.\n🎸 Act I: The Rock Show \u0026amp; Social Hub # Location: A raucous rock venue in the Market Ward. Hellasana has picked up a late-night performance slot. The crowd is small but energetic, and she becomes a local sensation for the night, gathering an impromptu fan club. Bru assists with technical support, tearing down gear and lamenting poor-quality stage setup by the prior act. Silas negotiates a lucrative performance contract with the venue while holding a mysterious briefcase full of gold. 🏁 Act II: Elspeth’s Underground Racing Comeback # Elspeth, a former professional racer, is navigating her return to the underground scene after a controversial disqualification. At the bar, she meets her former associate Thelvult, now sponsored by a major team. She reveals to Thelvult that she believes she was framed for race cheating (overpowering her vehicle), and that her car had been tampered with. Thelvult encourages her to join the upcoming underground race, providing her with contact info for Miss Talks, the punk-rock headhunter managing race entries. Elspeth signs up under the name Team Cooper, aware this might draw attention. 🏎️ Race Structure and Team Roles # The underground race on Sunday is large-scale (rumored 100 participants) and chaotic. Teams typically include:\nRacer Mechanic Spotter Saboteur (to disrupt other teams) Law Influencer (to manipulate legal consequences mid-race) Elspeth contemplates assembling her allies for these roles but hasn’t made formal asks yet. 🧳 Act III: The Briefcase Heist # Silas, Red, and Elspeth leave the club with a briefcase full of gold. Red carries Silas and the case through the city like a bodyguard. They attempt to reach Olivia’s apartment in the residential area, but are stopped by city guards. Visitors need special papers. Silas decides to forge the necessary documents using his charlatan skills, which will take at least an hour. The group detours back to a rented garage, where Elspeth discovers someone has tampered with her race car. 🛠️ Act IV: Investigation and Sabotage # While inspecting her vehicle, Elspeth confirms sabotage—someone who understands car mechanics tried to subtly damage her rig. Olivia joins the garage group early the next morning and sets up coffee and food. A Warforged named Racecar arrives with a cryptic warning: “You should not race. You are being targeted.” Racecar gives a clear description of the saboteur: a short, green-skinned goblin wearing black (turtleneck, gloves, pants). The team now has a suspect. Olivia, suspicious, interrogates Racecar and confirms the sabotage warning is real, but Racecar cannot name the culprit. 🍷 Act V: Hellasana \u0026amp; Bru’s Drunken Adventure # Hellasana and Bru, basking in post-show fame, party hard at the bar. Hellasana handles adoring fans while Bru gets blackout drunk. Bru eventually falls into a pool on the way to the motel and wanders lost before finally finding his room around 7 a.m. Hellasana secures her room with a fraction more dignity. 🔍 Act VI: Olivia’s Side Story – George \u0026amp; Finnegan # Olivia spends her night alone investigating the disappearance of her grand-nephew George. She stops by a local bodega (owned by “Bo Dega”) and chats with a shopkeeper. She learns George was seen with a suspicious halfling named Finnegan—charming, young, blonde, and always around shady people. Back at her apartment, Olivia finds a surprise note on her conspiracy board: “If I go missing, find my lockbox under Olivia Cooper. – George”\nShe adds “Finnegan” to her growing board of suspects and notes to install a security system. ☀️ Act VII: Morning of the Guild Job # As dawn breaks, the garage group wakes to coffee and muffins thanks to Olivia. They prepare for their 6 a.m. meeting with the Steven Guild, who had hired them to protect a caravan. The team shares intel about the upcoming race, Racecar’s warning, and the need to find out who sabotaged Elspeth’s car. Silas warns Red about a local Twilight Company branch operating near the venue—possibly dangerous or relevant to the race. The group now juggles multiple threads: A risky underground race A mysterious goblin saboteur A missing family member A performance tonight And a morning caravan job for the Steven Guild 🎭 Party Dynamics \u0026amp; Emerging Themes # Elspeth: Driven, betrayed racer seeking justice. Silas: Schemer with connections and charm, navigating danger with subtlety. Red: Loyal and strong, but possibly in over his head. Bru: Technical genius and chaos goblin—unpredictable but valuable. Hellasana: Rising star torn between fame and duty. Olivia: Savvy and deeply invested in both family and justice.

Silas – Scheming halfling rogue and manager of the band. Bru – Goblin artificer and chaos gremlin with a flair for pyrotechnics. Red (formerly Blue) – Goliath cleric, pacifist healer, and protector. Olivia – Elderly paladin with a cop-like sense of justice. Elspeth – Artificer gunslinger with a mechanical companion, BoxBox. Opening Scene: Chaos at the Tavern # The party is split between eating dinner and running a shell game when a Goliath barges into the Cog and Steam tavern shouting about “Bartley P. Thatch.” Chaos breaks out:\nA beer stein brains the Goliath. A full-on brawl begins. Bru magically engineers fart-scented peanuts and lobs them into the crowd. Olivia tries to intimidate the crowd but is punched and takes 4 damage. Silas steals 10 silver during the commotion and stealths away. Elspeth tries to back Olivia up with intimidation and BoxBox tackles a brawler. Red nervously assesses the situation and casts Guidance on Olivia. Bru sets off a fireworks cannon that creates fire-show chaos, followed by him throwing chairs and shouting “Fire!” while Kevin runs around screaming. Eventually, the tavern clears out thanks to a fire suppression system and Olivia and Elspeth’s crowd control. They leave the tavern in disarray. Post-Brawl: Recruitment Offer # Outside, a figure named Dirk from the Stephen Guild offers the party a job:\nGuard a caravan along the Gold Road to Eldoran. 500 gold for the job. Meeting time: 6 AM at the Garages Café near the caravan bays. The group is noncommittal and skeptical about the rate. Evening Activities # The party splits up:\n🎸 Hellasana # Investigates The Little Hovel, a dive metal club. Signs up to perform a set at 1 AM after scoping out terrible opening acts. Gains the attention of Sandra Talks, a sharply dressed talent agent scouting for a show. 🎲 Silas \u0026amp; Bru # Run a card cheating scam on local gamblers. Bru acts as spotter (poorly); Silas uses psychic dice and sleight of hand to win big. They win enough gold to buy burgers and reflect on their sloppy success. 🕶️ Red \u0026amp; Elspeth # Tag along to the Little Hovel to watch over the group. Red awkwardly wallflowers but eventually joins the others near the stage. Elspeth probes for underground racing contacts but doesn’t find much. Concert of the Century # Hellasana headlines the final act at The Little Hovel with support from Bru and Red:\nBru engineers stage pyrotechnics synced to the set. Red uses Thaumaturgy to enhance the flames with purple coloration. Hellasana delivers a transcendent metal performance enhanced by Guidance and Enhance Ability from Red. Audience members’ eyes glow purple, magic fills the air, and a surreal, euphoric concert atmosphere takes over. Performance rolls exceed 24. The show is an unforgettable success. Massive Payday # Silas negotiates a last-minute, high-profile gig with Sandra Talks for 10,000 gold: 1,000 gold up front in a suitcase. 6,000 upon arrival at the show. 3,000 after the show. The group is now flush with resources, contemplating splitting the gold and debating tour logistics (stay in van or book lodging). Cliffhanger \u0026amp; Next Steps # The group has conflicting commitments: a 6 AM meeting with Dirk and a high-paying concert the next night. They are now recognized as elite talent and might have choices to make between fame and duty.
