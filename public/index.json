However, their peaceful celebration is disrupted when an evil doppelganger of Caspian (the Winter King\u0026rsquo;s assistant) appears and corrupts the solstice magic, forcing the party into a series of battles to save the celebration.\nOpening: Solstice Festivities # The session opens with the village of Milstrom in full winter solstice celebration mode. The town square features:\nAn ice skating rink in the center A snowman building contest in a nearby field Carolers performing throughout the village A massive decorated Yule tree in the beer garden Various festive decorations and gatherings Party Activities # Silas and Bru operate a sketchy ice skate rental business, stealing townspeople\u0026rsquo;s skates and relabeling them with their own branding Red joins the snowman building contest with local children Billy, Jimmy, and Timmy, using his height advantage to build massive snowballs Elspeth sets up a tinkering booth making sleds and ball-throwing devices for free (much to Silas\u0026rsquo;s dismay) Hellasana explores the beer garden and festivities Olivia observes the celebration Introduction of Jasper Gaines # A new character enters the scene: Jasper Gaines, a human barbarian wearing Eldoran armor with dull crystal embellishments. He arrives leading a wagon full of beer casks for the tavern, demonstrating his connection to the local community through his friendship with Roscoe.\nThe Corrupted Solstice Attack # The Winter Storm # A sudden, unnatural winter storm descends upon the town, filled with pellets of snow and strange crystal dust that obscures everyone\u0026rsquo;s vision. When the storm clears, the entire celebration has been corrupted:\nChildren\u0026rsquo;s toys have been replaced with \u0026ldquo;werewolf erotica\u0026rdquo; Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s precious alcohol has been replaced with \u0026ldquo;bangers and mash\u0026rdquo; A child\u0026rsquo;s insulin has been replaced with a crystal figurine Various other gifts and celebration items have been corrupted The Impostor Revealed # From atop the church, a scantily clad water genasi in a bikini (despite the winter weather) reveals herself as \u0026ldquo;Caspian\u0026rdquo;. However, Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s religion knowledge (rolling an 18) reveals this is likely an impostor, as the real Caspian is known to be fully clothed and complains about magical image distortions.\nThe impostor declares: \u0026ldquo;Listen up, you wankers! I\u0026rsquo;ve turned evil now. I am Caspian Shores. I need to ruin your solstice.\u0026rdquo;\nInitial Combat # Jasper immediately attacks the impostor (dubbed \u0026ldquo;Negacast\u0026rdquo;) with his hand axes, dealing significant damage. The impostor retaliates by creating snow fists that attack Jasper, then disappears while promising more chaos.\nThree Crisis Points # The party must split their attention to handle three simultaneous magical attacks across the village:\nCrisis 1: The Corrupted Yule Tree # Location: Beer garden behind the pub\nThe massive 30-foot Yule tree becomes bewitched, with its decorative ribbons transforming into deadly tendrils that pierce villagers and transform them into Christmas ornaments that get pulled onto the tree.\nCombat Highlights:\nHellasana uses Misty Step to get to high ground and attacks with Eldritch Blast Olivia charges in with her battle axe, dealing massive damage with critical hits and Divine Smite Jasper follows up with devastating greatsword attacks using his berserker rage The party discovers a corrupted crystal tree topper that\u0026rsquo;s controlling the magic Hellasana destroys the crystal with psychic damage Eldritch Blasts, breaking the enchantment Resolution: The tree is toppled and the crystal destroyed, freeing all the ornament-people and returning them to normal.\nCrisis 2: The Snowman Army # Location: The snowman contest field\nAll the snowmen built for the contest come to life and begin attacking the children who built them. The party discovers that destroying individual snowmen only causes their snow to flow back to the giant snowman Red had built with the children.\nCombat Highlights:\nOlivia lights her battle axe on fire using lamp oil to combat the snow creatures Jasper performs an incredible flaming sword strike, sliding on the ice and lighting his blade mid-attack with bardic inspiration The party realizes they need to destroy the controlling crystal rather than the snowmen themselves Olivia delivers the killing blow to the crystal with Divine Smite Resolution: All snowmen return to normal snow once their controlling crystal is destroyed.\nCrisis 3: The Corrupted Carolers # Location: The carolers\u0026rsquo; stage\nThe carolers become possessed with milky white eyes and begin singing Norwegian death metal that mind-controls anyone who listens. Those affected begin joining the horrible song against their will.\nCombat Highlights:\nOnly Jasper (rolling a 21 perception) spots the controlling crystal above the stage Jasper charges through the mind-control effect with a successful charisma save Olivia summons her fey ram Bob and uses Fey Step to teleport directly to the action The party coordinates attacks while resisting the mind-control effects Multiple party members fall under the song\u0026rsquo;s influence and attack their allies The crystal is eventually destroyed, freeing all the carolers Resolution: The horrible music stops and the carolers return to normal holiday songs.\nFinal Confrontation: Negacast # The Ice Rink Battle # The party converges on the ice skating rink for the final confrontation with Negacast, who is revealed to be floating above the center of the rink.\nKey Combat Elements:\nThe ice rink becomes a battlefield with treacherous frozen terrain Negacast uses ice-based magic to restrain and attack the party Olivia lands a devastating critical hit with Divine Smite (40 damage total) Jasper deals consistent damage with his berserker rage Elspeth provides ranged support while BoxBox engages in melee The Protective Tattoos # During combat, the party notices strange tattoos on Negacast\u0026rsquo;s abdomen. Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s arcana check (17) identifies these as sigils of warding designed to keep out outside observation and presence.\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Crucial Role: Red successfully uses Dispel Magic to remove the protective tattoos, rolling exactly the DC needed (15) after using inspiration to reroll.\nThe Real Caspian\u0026rsquo;s Arrival # Once the protective wards are dispelled:\nGentle snowfall begins to replace the harsh storm All of Negacast\u0026rsquo;s corruptions across the town begin reversing automatically The real Caspian appears, wearing proper Winter King assistant attire (blue suit with crystal studs, appropriate for the weather) Caspian traps Negacast in a crystal prison for the party to deliver finishing blows Team Finishing Move # The party coordinates a spectacular team attack:\nHellasana blasts Jasper with Eldritch Blast to propel him forward Jasper and Olivia perform simultaneous cross-decapitation strikes The attack reveals Negacast wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually Caspian but some kind of construct or summoned being Negacast dissolves into snow and ash, with a screaming skull at its core that also disintegrates Resolution and Aftermath # Caspian\u0026rsquo;s Gratitude # The real Caspian thanks the party and:\nHeals all the injured villagers Completely reverses all the corruption (booze returns, proper gifts restored, etc.) Gives each party member beautiful crystal figurines as rewards Gives Elspeth an autographed copy of her favorite Caspian novel Helps restore the celebration atmosphere Gift Exchange Tradition # The party participates in a \u0026ldquo;White Owlbear\u0026rdquo; gift exchange (their world\u0026rsquo;s version of White Elephant):\nGifts Exchanged:\nHellasana receives: Silas\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;one crime carried out on your behalf\u0026rdquo; coupon Jasper receives: Olivia\u0026rsquo;s detective magnifying glass Elspeth receives: VIP tickets for 10 to \u0026ldquo;Gaines Brewery Bakery and Bankery\u0026rdquo; in Eldora Olivia receives: Hellasana\u0026rsquo;s bottle of Emmervale Elixir from High Forge Red receives: Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s custom train track with mini Vroomfall and Doomfall cars Silas and Bru\u0026rsquo;s exchange: Deferred to next session Celebration Continues # Despite the interruptions, the village successfully continues their winter solstice celebration with:\nThe Yule tree restored to its upright position Children healed and gifts returned Community spirit restored A general atmosphere of warmth and celebration Cliffhanger: Crowley\u0026rsquo;s Return # As Caspian prepares to leave town using the Winter King\u0026rsquo;s magic to travel on the north wind, she finds herself trapped in an eerie void with no stars or ambient sound.\nCrowley\u0026rsquo;s Appearance: The fae entity Crowley appears in a caroler\u0026rsquo;s outfit (top hat and puffy jacket), singing a menacing version of \u0026ldquo;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u0026rdquo; with threatening lyrics. He greets Caspian as an \u0026ldquo;old friend,\u0026rdquo; revealing their prior history, and the scene cuts to black after he blows out his candle.\nImplications: This suggests Crowley has larger plans involving multiple powerful beings and may have been behind the Negacast attack as part of a broader scheme.\nCharacter Development # Jasper Gaines Integration # Successfully proved his worth to the party through consistent combat effectiveness Demonstrated connection to local community (friendship with Roscoe) Showed tactical thinking and berserker combat prowess Improved Eldoran reputation in the village through heroic actions Party Dynamics # Excellent teamwork displayed across multiple simultaneous combat encounters Creative problem-solving with environmental obstacles (ice, fire, crystals) Strong coordination in the final team attack sequence Growing acceptance of Jasper as a temporary or permanent party member Red\u0026rsquo;s Growth # Successfully used Dispel Magic at a crucial moment Showed improved tactical awareness in identifying magical threats Continued role as primary healer and support character Genuine joy in receiving the toy train set gift Combat and Mechanical Highlights # New 2024 D\u0026amp;D Rules in Action # Jasper\u0026rsquo;s barbarian abilities showcased the improved skill system (using Strength for Perception) Mount combat mechanics with Olivia and Bob the ram Creative use of environmental factors (fire, ice, crystals) Effective use of bardic inspiration and team coordination Tactical Elements # Multi-front combat requiring party coordination Environmental puzzle-solving (identifying crystals as weak points) Creative weapon enhancement (lighting axes on fire) Effective use of positioning and battlefield control Ongoing Plot Threads # Crowley\u0026rsquo;s Master Plan: The fae entity appears to be targeting powerful magical beings systematically Eldoran Relations: Jasper\u0026rsquo;s presence and heroics improve relations between Milstrom and Eldora Gaines Brewery Mystery: The tickets suggest potential future adventures in Eldora Caspian\u0026rsquo;s Fate: Her capture by Crowley may require future rescue efforts Party Composition: Jasper\u0026rsquo;s potential permanent addition to the group Session Themes # This session expertly balanced holiday festivities with serious threats, showcasing:\nCommunity Spirit: The importance of protecting celebration and tradition Teamwork: Multiple simultaneous threats requiring coordination Good vs. Corruption: The contrast between genuine celebration and twisted imitations New Alliances: Jasper\u0026rsquo;s integration and improved Eldoran relations Growing Threats: Crowley\u0026rsquo;s expanding influence and mysterious master plan The winter solstice setting provided an excellent backdrop for both heartwarming community moments and dramatic magical combat, while the cliffhanger ending sets up significant future plot developments involving Crowley\u0026rsquo;s schemes.\n","date":"21 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-18/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party returns to Milstrom for winter solstice festivities, only to face an evil doppelganger threatening their celebration.","title":"Session Eighteen: Winter Solstice","type":"sessions"},{"content":"Look back at session summaries from the entire campaign.\n","date":"21 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/","section":"Sessions","summary":"","title":"Sessions","type":"sessions"},{"content":" The Moon\u0026rsquo;s Destruction # The session opens with the catastrophic destruction of the real moon by Eldora\u0026rsquo;s artificial satellite. The party witnesses Luminar, the moon goddess, falling to earth as a brilliant streak of light after her celestial body explodes. The impact creates massive shockwaves and a golden glow on the eastern horizon, fundamentally altering the cosmic balance.\nThe party realizes this represents Eldora\u0026rsquo;s systematic campaign to eliminate rival gods from the pantheon, making herself the sole divine power. Red becomes particularly concerned about Tyr\u0026rsquo;s safety, fearing he may lose his divine powers if his god is killed.\nQuestioning Father Jacob # After the cranky Father Jacob finally finishes his morning coffee, the party extracts crucial information about Red\u0026rsquo;s origins:\nThe Skyhammer Massacre: When Red was an infant, Eldoran Knights attacked his village, killing most warriors and taking the scientists and technological knowledge The Skyhammer Program: Red\u0026rsquo;s clan has been working on building starships to reach space and potentially destroy Eldora\u0026rsquo;s fake moon Red\u0026rsquo;s Importance: His bloodline is somehow essential to powering their spacecraft, though the exact mechanism remains mysterious The Rescue: The Crosses (Red\u0026rsquo;s adoptive parents) were Tyr followers who helped hide Red from the Eldoran forces Consulting the Prophecy Sheep # Olivia and Elspeth hike to consult the reborn oracle sheep, learning disturbing prophecies:\nMore gods will die in the coming conflict Jeremy (the shepherd) will die prematurely if they don\u0026rsquo;t intervene to save the world The moon goddess could potentially be revived, but it would require asking another god for help The sheep mentions a mysterious figure called \u0026ldquo;Tony\u0026rdquo; - possibly a mechanical or builder god Meanwhile, Bru attempts unsuccessfully to recruit the prophetic sheep for his \u0026ldquo;army.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Journey to the Skyhammers # The party begins their ascent up Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s Spine mountain, with George providing enthusiastic (if verbose) exposition about Project Purple Patch and his research into the Goliath clans. The two-and-a-half-day journey tests their mountaineering skills, but their magical cold-resistant cloaks and Bob the goat help them navigate the treacherous terrain.\nDuring evening camps, the party engages in character development:\nRed performs augury rituals, receiving divine confirmation they\u0026rsquo;re on the right path Silas begins teaching George lockpicking and other \u0026ldquo;Twilight Company skills\u0026rdquo; Olivia has stern conversations with George about the moral implications of criminal associations Discovering the Skyhammer Village # Upon reaching the mountain\u0026rsquo;s summit, the party encounters Goliath sentries and is escorted into a remarkable settlement:\nVillage Features # Advanced Technology: Solar panels, electric lights, aluminum and steel construction The Rocket Platform: A massive partially-constructed spacecraft dominates the village center Solarpunk Aesthetic: Technology integrated harmoniously with the mountain environment Crystal-Powered Equipment: White crystal technology similar to but distinct from Eldoran violaceous crystals Defensive Preparations: Guards equipped with railguns and crystal-embedded weapons Meeting Elder Ragar # The party is brought before Ragar, an ancient Goliath elder who serves as the clan\u0026rsquo;s leader. During their formal meeting:\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Recognition # Red\u0026rsquo;s tattoo style matches the clan\u0026rsquo;s artistic traditions His knowledge of his birth name (Thurnok Skyhammer) helps establish his identity The revelation of Marion and Robert Cross\u0026rsquo;s murder saddens the clan, as they had lost contact The Bloodline Mystery # Only someone of the Skyhammer bloodline can power their spacecraft The knowledge of how this works was lost when Red\u0026rsquo;s birth parents died The clan believes the trials will either unlock this knowledge or kill Red in the attempt The Trials Ahead # Ragar explains that Red must enter the \u0026ldquo;Worms Tunnel\u0026rdquo; - a mystical passage carved by an ancient serpent that created reality-warping trials. Only the main Skyhammer bloodline can survive these tests, which are necessary to prove Red\u0026rsquo;s heritage and unlock the secrets of powering their starship.\nParty Dynamics and Rewards # Silas immediately begins negotiating for rewards, delighting when Ragar indicates they will indeed compensate the party for returning their lost prince. This represents a rare instance of the party receiving recognition for their heroic efforts.\nGeorge enthusiasts himself by planning to catalog valuable technologies while the others undergo trials, much to Silas\u0026rsquo;s approval and Olivia\u0026rsquo;s moral concern.\nThe Approach to Trials # The session concludes as Ragar leads the party to an enormous circular cave entrance marked with runic symbols and buffeted by mysterious winds. Silas establishes psychic communication links with Red, Olivia, and Elspeth before they enter.\nThe party faces the prospect of Red either proving his royal bloodline and unlocking the power to fuel their cosmic rebellion against Eldora, or dying in the attempt.\nKey Revelations # Eldora\u0026rsquo;s Divine Genocide: The systematic elimination of competing gods Skyhammer Technology: Advanced crystal-powered spacecraft construction Red\u0026rsquo;s Cosmic Destiny: His bloodline\u0026rsquo;s connection to powering interstellar travel The Worms Tunnel: Ancient trials that will determine Red\u0026rsquo;s fate and abilities George\u0026rsquo;s Development: Growing from naive enthusiasm into potential competence Ongoing Threats # The destruction of traditional divine powers The challenge of proving Red\u0026rsquo;s lineage through deadly trials The need to develop technology capable of challenging Eldora\u0026rsquo;s space-based power The moral education of George within criminal organizations The session masterfully balances cosmic-scale threats with intimate character development, setting up a crucial trial sequence that will determine both Red\u0026rsquo;s identity and the party\u0026rsquo;s ability to challenge divine tyranny on a celestial scale.\n","date":"14 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-17/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party reaches Red\u0026rsquo;s ancestral clan and discovers advanced technology, but Red must prove his lineage through dangerous trials.","title":"Session Seventeen: The Skyhammers","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Post-Temple Recovery # The session begins immediately after the party\u0026rsquo;s victory over the corrupted shrine\u0026rsquo;s guardians. Having defeated the Lacuna and the demon that was helping her, the party takes a much-needed short rest to recover from their injuries. The temple\u0026rsquo;s protective wards have been restored, but their efforts have revealed a new challenge: a crackling portal has appeared beside the temple, showing shadows moving on the other side.\nDuring the short rest:\nHelisanna provides bardic inspiration through her musical performance, with purple mist emanating from her axe toward party members Red uses Balm of Peace to heal the most injured party members Silas investigates the temple structure, discovering it was designed to create planar stability in the region The Shadowfell Portal Discovery # As the party recovers, they hear a familiar voice calling from beyond the crackling rift. George, Olivia\u0026rsquo;s grandson, can be seen through the portal along with the other pilgrims, including Father Jacob. George calls out desperately:\n\u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rsquo;s there? Can you hear me? We\u0026rsquo;re trapped. The shadows twist and pulse around the rips.\u0026rdquo;\nRed\u0026rsquo;s religion check (natural 20, total 25) reveals this is a rift to the Shadowfell - a bleak realm of perpetual twilight where emotions are dulled and hope is scarce. Prolonged exposure drains creatures of vitality and will to live. The pilgrims appear to be flickering between states, caught between realms.\nFather Jacob warns that \u0026ldquo;the rift must be closed, else Shadowfell will be open to our world.\u0026rdquo;\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s Impulsive Decision # Without hesitation or consultation with her party, Olivia immediately responds to seeing George trapped. She uses Divine Smite to forcefully break open the rift, despite Red having Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s portal-closing amulet that could have safely handled the situation.\nThis decision triggers immediate combat as shadows begin spilling through the enlarged rift.\nShadow Combat Encounter # The party faces multiple types of shadow creatures emerging from the Shadowfell:\nEnemy Forces # Shadow Horde: Multiple shadow creatures that function like minions (one hit kills) The Haunt: A powerful entity that can move through creatures and cause massive psychic damage Wraith: A dangerous undead creature with various resistances Combat Highlights # Round 1:\nHelisanna opens with Thunderwave, destroying one shadow but learning they have constitution saves Bru casts Fairy Fire, outlining the shadows in blue light and granting advantage on attacks Elspeth systematically destroys shadows with her axe and magic gun, killing three in one turn Round 2-3:\nThe Haunt moves through multiple party members, forcing wisdom saves and dealing massive psychic damage (33 damage, half on save) Both Olivia and Elspeth are knocked unconscious by the haunt\u0026rsquo;s devastating area attack Silas demonstrates impressive skill by eliminating all remaining shadows with a single curved psychic blade attack, using his enhanced capabilities Round 4-5:\nEldoran Knight arrives as reinforcement, healing Elspeth for 15 points and dealing significant damage to enemies Red focuses on using Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s amulet to close the portal, requiring concentration over multiple turns Bru provides consistent damage with his Eldritch Cannon (flamethrower variant) Final Rounds:\nHelisanna switches to warlock abilities, using Hex and Eldritch Blast to eliminate the minor devil Olivia, after being revived, uses her divine abilities to devastating effect against the remaining enemies Elspeth delivers the killing blow to the wraith with her magic gun and Green Flame Blade Portal Closure and Rescue # Red successfully uses Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s amulet to close the Shadowfell portal, weaving streams of white light like thread and needle to seal the rift. The shadows on the other side are trapped as the portal closes, and the pilgrims successfully escape to safety.\nReunion and Revelations # The emotional reunion between Olivia and George reveals several important details:\nGeorge\u0026rsquo;s Activities # He has been working with the Twilight Company on Project Purple Patch His mission involved investigating and closing Shadowfell rifts in the mountain region He was part of Father Jacob\u0026rsquo;s pilgrim group attempting to seal the rift George has been learning various skills from a mentor named Finnegan, including cocktail making and lockpicking Character Dynamics # Olivia is both relieved and concerned about George\u0026rsquo;s involvement with the \u0026ldquo;shady\u0026rdquo; Twilight Company George defends the organization, saying they\u0026rsquo;re working against the Empire Silas pickpockets 5 gold from George during the reunion, then returns it as a \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo; of George\u0026rsquo;s awareness The Eldoran Knight Encounter # The party interacts with the Eldoran Knight who helped during combat. She wears the characteristic gem-embedded armor but her crystals appear dull and blackened rather than bright:\nKnight\u0026rsquo;s Background # She was sent on a mission to combat Shadowfell incursions Represents the Order of Eldora and their ongoing military operations Expresses the Empire\u0026rsquo;s religious supremacist views about extinguishing other gods Reward Negotiation # Helisanna negotiates for material compensation (rolling 24 on persuasion) The knight provides 10 gold total and offers a recommendation in Eldora She shares information about the High Forge dragon attack, confirming the city\u0026rsquo;s destruction Reveals that Eldoran forces fought the dragons but suffered casualties Religious Tensions # The knight espouses disturbing views about religious warfare: \u0026ldquo;It has become clear to us over the last century that we must extinguish other gods to gain validity in our own religion.\u0026rdquo;\nThis leads to pointed criticism from the party about forced conversions and religious persecution.\nJourney to Jeremy\u0026rsquo;s House # The party decides to head down the mountain to Jeremy the shepherd\u0026rsquo;s house for rest and warmth. During the journey:\nTravel Arrangements # Multiple people ride Jeremy\u0026rsquo;s magical sheep (the three dimensional-shifting lambs) Kevin (Bru\u0026rsquo;s minion) rides with the small party members The Eldoran Knight struggles with her summoned war horse on the mountain terrain Red\u0026rsquo;s Heritage Discussion # The party discusses Red\u0026rsquo;s potential royal heritage as prince of the Skyhammer clan His tattoos and the information from his mother\u0026rsquo;s journal confirm his identity Plans are made to eventually seek out his people in the mountains Brief Encounters # They pass Erica (the Eldoran knight from earlier sessions) who was eating a magical dinner Silas mocks her equipment, noting her crystals are \u0026ldquo;smoky and dull\u0026rdquo; unlike typical Eldoran gear Rest at Jeremy\u0026rsquo;s Cottage # The party reaches Jeremy\u0026rsquo;s cottage where they prepare for a long rest:\nAccommodation # The cottage is cramped but warm Pilgrims set up in the barn while the party stays in the house Jeremy offers hospitality despite the crowded conditions Evening Activities # Bru spends the evening tinkering and fixing Jeremy\u0026rsquo;s broken furniture and dishes Helisanna plays casual guitar, with purple energy strands emanating into the environment and even the ground Radio broadcasts provide news about Astral Dragons heading toward their world and recruitment for the \u0026ldquo;Eldoran Space Force\u0026rdquo; The Moon\u0026rsquo;s Destruction # The session ends with a catastrophic revelation during Bru\u0026rsquo;s night watch:\nThe Cosmic Event # While keeping watch due to his Alert feat, Bru hears crackling sounds like magma and glass grinding coming from space. Looking up, he witnesses:\nCracks appearing in the real moon, lighting up with magma A massive female figure larger than the sky falling toward their world The moon exploding completely An eardrum-shattering scream accompanying the celestial destruction This apocalyptic event suggests that while they still have the artificial Eldoran moon, the destruction of the natural moon will have profound consequences for their world.\nCharacter Development and Themes # Olivia\u0026rsquo;s Impulsiveness # Olivia\u0026rsquo;s immediate action to save George without consulting the party demonstrates her deep family loyalty but also her tendency toward decisive, potentially dangerous action.\nReligious and Political Tensions # The session reinforces themes about religious extremism and imperial expansion through the Eldoran knight\u0026rsquo;s disturbing views on theological supremacy.\nEscalating Cosmic Threats # The progression from local demon problems to dragons attacking cities to moon destruction shows the campaign\u0026rsquo;s scope expanding to cosmic-level threats.\nFamily and Loyalty # The George rescue subplot emphasizes family bonds and the lengths characters will go to protect loved ones, while also showing generational differences in approach to resistance movements.\nLoot and Mechanical Notes # 10 gold total from the Eldoran knight Long rest achieved, allowing the party to reach Level 6 Bru gains new infusions and continues developing his minion army Silas notes achieving Reliable Talent with his level advancement Ongoing Plot Threads # The destroyed moon\u0026rsquo;s consequences for tides, lycanthropy, and cosmic balance Red\u0026rsquo;s royal heritage and potential connections to mountain clans Escalating planar instability with multiple rift incidents Twilight Company operations and their broader resistance network Eldoran expansion and religious persecution campaigns Astral Dragon threats requiring space-based military response Jeremy\u0026rsquo;s mysterious background as a former vampire hunter The session masterfully balances character development, family drama, cosmic horror, and political commentary while advancing multiple plot threads toward what appears to be an apocalyptic climax involving the destruction of fundamental celestial bodies.\n","date":"12 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-16/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party rescues George from the Shadowfell and witnesses a catastrophic celestial event.","title":"Session Sixteen: Olivia's Decision","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Recap and Setup # The session begins with the party having successfully helped Jeffrey corral his escaped magical sheep. They recruited several of Jeffrey\u0026rsquo;s lambs, which are now following Bru around as he attempts to train them in military formations. The party has received magical Woolen Cloaks of the Mountain Guardians from Jeffrey - these self-resizing magical cloaks provide resistance to cold damage both environmental and in combat.\nThe party is now pursuing George (Olivia\u0026rsquo;s grandson) and a group of Tyr pilgrims up Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s Spine, following the trail of Project Purple Patch - a Twilight Company investigation into supernatural disturbances in the mountain region.\nThe Ascent of Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s Spine # As the party climbs higher up the mountain following an established stone pathway marked with Tyr iconography, the environment becomes increasingly harsh and ominous:\nEnvironmental Changes: The landscape grows more jagged, temperatures drop significantly, and shadows extend unnaturally far beyond where sunlight should reach Supernatural Activity: The party encounters translucent figures of religious pilgrims in Tyr vestments who appear to be caught in mid-conversation, discussing \u0026ldquo;the breach,\u0026rdquo; efforts to \u0026ldquo;close the breach,\u0026rdquo; and their failure Psychological Effects: Party members begin experiencing an oppressive feeling of being watched, with movement glimpsed in peripheral vision that disappears when looked at directly Perception Check Results: Silas and Red are able to make out details of the ghostly pilgrims and catch fragments of their conversations about a failed mission to seal some kind of breach.\nDiscovery of the Abandoned Campsite # The party discovers a cold campsite in a clearing containing:\nPhysical Evidence # Three large tents capable of housing 3-4 people each Cold fire pit with frozen water bucket Winter camping supplies including dehydrated meals and frozen bread Religious vestments and Tyr scripture, particularly early dwarven Tyr stories Father Jacob\u0026rsquo;s Journal # Helisanna discovers and reads aloud a journal entry from Father Jacob, dated the 3rd moon of October (about a week prior):\n\u0026ldquo;By Tyr\u0026rsquo;s guiding hand, we have reached the shrine on Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s spine. The Ascendants tested our resolve, yet we remain steadfast in our mission. The breach must be sealed, for the rift to the Shadowfell grows ever more unstable. Its malevolence seeps into our world, corrupting all it touches. We go through the divine words as instructed, but something is amiss. The shadows move as though alive, whispering to us, mocking our efforts. I sense a presence here, ancient and insidious, feeding on the despair of this place. The others feel it too.

As they approach, they experience:\nIntensifying Psychological Effects # All party members are struck by overwhelming feelings of grief and dread, causing them to relive their most traumatic memories:\nOlivia: The death of her husband in a cupcake explosion at his bakery Red: Finding his deceased parents Helisanna: The grief of losing her former self when she created her new persona Silas: The deaths of other Sisyphus Circle members during the failed heist with Bru The Corrupted Shrine Structure # The shrine consists of:\nFour Protective Pillars: Originally designed with Tyr iconography including stacked stones (symbol of balance), but now bearing burn marks and demonic corruption Central Statue: A weeping dwarf woman holding a vase, meant to represent a story of devotion and community service, but corrupted to appear sad instead of confident Corrupted Magic: Silver chains of divine binding magic flowing from the pillars to the statue, being cut through and corrupted by streams of black smoke Red\u0026rsquo;s Religion Check (25): Recognizes this as a corruption of a traditional Tyr shrine where protective wards have been compromised by demonic influence. The statue represents a woman who fetched water daily regardless of circumstances - normally depicted as confident and forward-looking, but now corrupted to appear grief-stricken.\nCombat: The Battle for the Shrine # Initiative and Combatants # Enemies: Lacuna: A corrupted, teleporting statue that causes despair and can phase between realities Matt Damon: A demon that manifests when the party begins dispelling corruption Party Initiative: Helisanna (22), Bru (14), Olivia (11), Silas (10), Red (9), Elspeth (5) Round-by-Round Combat Summary # Round 1:\nHelisanna: Casts Mirror Image for protection and gives Red bardic inspiration Bru: Creates and places his Eldritch Cannon (flamethrower variant) on Olivia\u0026rsquo;s shoulder Lacuna: Teleports closer and hits most of the party with a despair effect (DC 20 Wisdom save) - only Red succeeds, causing all others to have attacks made against them with advantage for one minute Olivia: Charges in with her battleaxe, using Sacred Weapon and Divine Smite for massive radiant damage (22 total), attempts to topple the statue but it\u0026rsquo;s immune Silas: Successfully repairs one of the corrupted ward pillars using religion checks, causing silver chains to glow and begin restraining the statue Red: Uses Dispel Magic to cleanse corruption from a second pillar, further weakening Lacuna\u0026rsquo;s defenses Round 2:\nElspeth: Flanks with Olivia, using Green Flame Blade and her crossbow for solid damage Helisanna: Dominates with Eldritch Blast, dealing 50 damage in a single turn through critical hits and Hex Demon Manifestation: When Red dispels the second pillar, a demon appears demanding \u0026ldquo;What are you doing to my temple?\u0026rdquo; Lacuna: Teleports to Elspeth and deals massive damage (29 psychic), nearly killing her Round 3-4:\nOlivia: Uses Lay on Hands to heal Elspeth multiple times, keeping her alive through the fight Bru: Activates his cannon for area damage and casts Firebolt Silas: Works on the third pillar while the others hold the line Red: Heals the party with Balm of Peace and summons a Spiritual Weapon Lacuna: Continues teleporting and dealing heavy damage, knocking out both Olivia and Elspeth at different points Final Round:\nHelisanna: Successfully dispels the final pillar corruption, causing the demon to dissipate and weakening Lacuna significantly Restored Wards: With all pillars cleansed, Lacuna becomes fully corporeal and loses her damage resistances Bru: Deals significant thunder damage with Shatter (21 damage) Silas: Delivers the killing blow with a critical sneak attack for 31 damage, using his psychic powers to target the creature\u0026rsquo;s life force core Combat Resolution # As Lacuna dies, she appears relieved to be freed from her corrupted existence. The shrine\u0026rsquo;s protective wards fully activate, silver chains properly connecting all pillars to the central statue, and the oppressive atmosphere lifts.\nSession Conclusion # With the shrine cleansed and the immediate threat eliminated, the party discovers a black rift portal where they can make out figures moving and talking on the other side.

They had recently dealt with Magnolia\u0026rsquo;s drug-addled state, discovered that Z was the murderer of Red\u0026rsquo;s parents, found Z\u0026rsquo;s journal after he burned down his own house, and learned he had fled to Eldoran. The party also negotiated with Tien\u0026rsquo;s caravan to wait for their return for 200 gold, and Bodega set up shop in the town they had recently helped liberate.\nThe Pilgrimage Begins # The party set out on the Path of the Pilgrim up Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s Spine mountain. Along the trail, they noticed:\nStones etched with scales, some ancient and moss-covered, others freshly scratched A weathered trail sign reading \u0026ldquo;Path of the pilgrim\u0026rdquo; A warning scrawled beneath: \u0026ldquo;Beware the shadows\u0026rdquo; Thick fog and strange echoing sounds resembling distant hymns Jeffrey the Shepherd # Before reaching the main trail, the party encountered Jeffrey Thompson (later called \u0026ldquo;Jeff again,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;J-Shot,\u0026rdquo; and finally settling on \u0026ldquo;Jeff\u0026rdquo;), a struggling shepherd trying to corral his unruly magical sheep. Jeffrey revealed several important details:\nHe had only been shepherding for a couple of months after buying the property cheaply His previous job was ruined by an \u0026ldquo;enemy\u0026rdquo; Recent pilgrims had passed through and were heard screaming before disappearing The sheep had minds of their own and played pranks on him The Sheep Collection # The party took on the task of helping Jeffrey round up his six sheep:\nBessie - The Lightning Ewe # A massive, muscular ewe perched on a cliff Could shoot lightning and jump 100 feet in the air Strategy: Olivia summoned her fey ram companion Bob (spelled B-A-A-A-A-B) to seduce Bessie Outcome: Romantic success - Bob and Bessie retreated to the barn for intimate activities, creating a new \u0026ldquo;more perfect goat\u0026rdquo; offspring Gus - The Cliff Climber # A ram who enjoyed climbing near-vertical cliff faces Strategy: Helisanna used the Levitate spell to float Gus down from the cliffside Outcome: Successfully delivered to the barn via magical levitation The Lamb Trio - The Dimensional Pranksters # When the party entered the forest to find the three lambs, strange dimensional effects began occurring:\nDimensional Displacement: Touching or being near the lambs caused party members to be transported to other planes temporarily\nHelisanna: Heard whispers about \u0026ldquo;the dark one\u0026rdquo; calling and needing to be fed Bru: Heard messages about being expected and needing to go \u0026ldquo;further afield\u0026rdquo; Elspeth: Repeatedly heard the word \u0026ldquo;racist\u0026rdquo; Red: Witnessed the endless war in the Nine Hells with demons fighting devils Olivia: Saw a robotic apocalypse with organized automatons Various party members: Some were transported to heavenly realms with angels and golden forests Resolution: The party successfully persuaded the lambs to join \u0026ldquo;Bru\u0026rsquo;s Army\u0026rdquo; after they chose Bru as their leader\nOld Myrtle - The Wise Oracle # The final sheep was found in a cave, revealed to be far more than an ordinary animal:\nTrue Nature: Old Myrtle was a sheep possessed by the spirit of a god Abilities: Could speak and provided cryptic prophetic warnings Key Revelations: Recent pilgrims were \u0026ldquo;lost between worlds\u0026rdquo; - stuck between planes, neither alive nor dead The shadow realm was weakening and reaching into their world She would soon cease to exist and be replaced by the offspring of Bob and Bessie Fate: Upon returning to Jeffrey\u0026rsquo;s cottage, Old Myrtle immediately disintegrated into bones and wool The Radio Transmission # While at Jeffrey\u0026rsquo;s cottage, the party heard a disturbing radio transmission:\nOrigin: Appeared to be from a space station near Eldoran\u0026rsquo;s moon Content: Astronauts reported discovering Void Dragons - large, winged, reptilian entities emerging from an unknown portal near Venus Significance: The dragons were described as light-absorbing creatures moving in coordinated formations toward the observers Jeff\u0026rsquo;s Revelations # Under a Zone of Truth spell, Jeffrey revealed his troubled past:\nVampire Hunters: He was being actively hunted by vampires after escaping from their underwater city Previous Life: His last shepherding job was destroyed by his \u0026ldquo;enemy\u0026rdquo; Eldoran Knowledge: He knew that Eldoran\u0026rsquo;s second moon was artificial - a manufactured satellite created when Eldora ascended to godhood The Birth of New Myrtle # The session concluded with a spectacular magical event:\nA brilliant light emanated from the barn where Bob and Bessie had been A young sheep emerged, floating in golden light The lamb rapidly aged into an exact replica of Old Myrtle before walking off into the pasture This fulfilled Old Myrtle\u0026rsquo;s prophecy about being replaced by \u0026ldquo;a new, more perfect goat\u0026rdquo; Rewards and Setup # The party received Woolen Cloaks of the Mountain Guardians providing cold resistance. The session ended with the formation of \u0026ldquo;Bru\u0026rsquo;s Army\u0026rdquo; - consisting of:\nThe three dimensional-shifting lambs Gus the cliff-climber Jeffrey as \u0026ldquo;upper middle management\u0026rdquo; and army chef Various party members in leadership roles The stage was set for the party to continue their pilgrimage up Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s Spine, now accompanied by their unusual army of magical sheep and armed with knowledge about the shadow realm\u0026rsquo;s intrusion into their world.\nNotable Character Moments # Bru established himself as a natural leader of magical creatures, forming his \u0026ldquo;evil army\u0026rdquo; Olivia successfully played matchmaker between her summoned mount and Bessie Helisanna demonstrated practical magic use with the levitation of Gus Silas showed his investigative skills in tracking and survival Red experienced visions of the Nine Hells, providing cosmic context Elspeth dealt with mysterious accusations of being a \u0026ldquo;racist\u0026rdquo; from Old Myrtle The session successfully blended comedy with darker undertones about dimensional instability and cosmic threats, setting up future adventures while providing memorable character interactions and problem-solving scenarios.\n","date":"17 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-14/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party begins their pilgrimage up Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s Spine mountain, where they encounter a peculiar shepherd and his unruly magical sheep.","title":"Session Fourteen: Ascending Grimvar's Spine","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # In this pivotal session, the party deals with the aftermath of their battle at the corrupted druid shrine, makes crucial decisions about Frankie\u0026rsquo;s lycanthropy, and uncovers devastating truths about Red\u0026rsquo;s family history while accidentally destroying evidence in a house fire.\nKey Events # Closing the Portal # The session opens with Eleanor successfully closing the infernal portal at the shrine using her ancestral amulet. The portal collapses after a final desperate attempt by devils to break through, with a spectral clawed hand trying to drag itself into the world. Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s magic prevails, cleansing the shrine and restoring it to its natural state as gentle rain begins to fall and flowers bloom where corruption once festered.\nEleanor presents the Portal-Closing Amulet to Red, explaining it can be used to close other infernal rifts they might encounter in their travels.\nFrankie\u0026rsquo;s Transformation Decision # The party engages in an extensive discussion about Frankie the werewolf\u0026rsquo;s future. Eleanor offers three options:\nFull healing - Complete removal of lycanthropy Controlled lycanthropy - Maintain werewolf abilities with control, but risk becoming an uncontrollable beast during rare celestial alignments (twice yearly) Status quo - Remain as currently affected The decision is complicated by the presence of the artificial Eldoran moon, which forces Frankie to transform every night rather than just during full moons. After much deliberation and discussion about celestial alignments and potential solutions (including jokes about \u0026ldquo;blowing up the moon\u0026rdquo;), the party unanimously chooses full healing. Eleanor successfully performs the ritual, restoring Frankie to human form.\nPolitical Aftermath in Milstrom # Returning to town, the party encounters a town meeting at the Common Mug. The citizens are debating their future governance after the mayor\u0026rsquo;s death:\nWillamay advocates for a democratic council elected by the people Boone Rockwell suggests expanding the existing council structure rather than complete change Maggie and Big O support whatever keeps the community strong When asked for their input, the party\u0026rsquo;s suggestions range from single leadership (Silas) to representation and accountability (Olivia) to completely unconventional ideas (Goblin Law from Bru). Ultimately, they recommend taking time to consider all options rather than making hasty decisions, leading the town to postpone the decision for a month.\nThe Magnolia Investigation # Following up on Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s tip about Red\u0026rsquo;s parents\u0026rsquo; murder, the party visits Magnolia, an elderly halfling woman who lives in a cottage filled with quilted furniture. During their visit over tea (which contains mild hallucinogenic herbs), Magnolia reveals crucial information:\nShe witnessed Zeke leaving Red\u0026rsquo;s parents\u0026rsquo; house on the night they died She overheard an argument between Zeke and Red\u0026rsquo;s parents After Zeke left, she heard Red\u0026rsquo;s parents discussing how \u0026ldquo;Zeke knows too much\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;maybe they will take care of him\u0026rdquo; She then heard sounds of violence and believes it was a murder-suicide triggered by whatever Zeke told them Important Note: Magnolia\u0026rsquo;s reliability as a witness is questionable due to her regular consumption of mildly psychoactive tea that affects memory.\nBreaking into Zeke\u0026rsquo;s Cottage # The party locates Zeke\u0026rsquo;s cottage in the woods, finding it apparently empty but with a fire still burning. Silas successfully picks the lock after disarming a needle trap, but the group\u0026rsquo;s investigation leads to disaster:\nKey Discoveries:\nZeke\u0026rsquo;s Journal: Reveals he is a spy for the Eldoran Empire Murder Revelation: Zeke deliberately poisoned the well water at Red\u0026rsquo;s family home, making their deaths appear like illness rather than murder Surveillance: Zeke has been monitoring Red and tracking Goliath movements in the mountains Escape Plans: Recent entries suggest Zeke was preparing to leave town The Fire Disaster: While investigating, the party accidentally causes a grease fire when trying to extinguish Zeke\u0026rsquo;s cooking pot. Their attempts to put it out with water only make it worse, and the cottage burns down completely. Fortunately, they escape with Zeke\u0026rsquo;s journal and a bag of the same herbs Magnolia uses in her tea.\nThe Chase and Escape # Using survival skills enhanced by psychic abilities, Silas tracks Zeke\u0026rsquo;s trail from the burned cottage to the Gold Road, where they discover:\nZeke rendezvoused with horses and riders Purple wisps (possibly magical tracking traces) lead toward the horizon He has too much of a head start to catch on foot The party realizes Zeke is likely heading to Eldora, putting their investigation on hold until they can follow.\nNegotiating the Caravan Delay # Before departing on the Pilgrim\u0026rsquo;s Path to search for Olivia\u0026rsquo;s grandson George, the party needs to handle their contract with Tien\u0026rsquo;s tiefling trading caravan. Helisana attempts to negotiate having them wait, but despite having advantage from party assistance, rolls poorly and ends up agreeing to pay 200 gold for the traders to wait in Milstrom during their detour.\nSetting Out on the Pilgrim\u0026rsquo;s Path # The session concludes with the party beginning their journey on the Pilgrim\u0026rsquo;s Path with Roscoe as their guide. The landscape shifts from vibrant colors to muted grays as they climb into the mountains, following ancient stones marked with the balanced scales of Tyr.\nThey make camp for the evening and spot a shepherd\u0026rsquo;s cottage with smoke rising from its chimney, setting up the next leg of their adventure.\nCharacter Development \u0026amp; Relationships # Red processes the devastating revelation about his parents\u0026rsquo; murder and the identity of their killer Olivia demonstrates leadership in political discussions and shows crafting skills by making gifts Silas proves invaluable with his investigative and stealth abilities, though his greed continues to be a defining trait Helisana struggles with substance use throughout the session, affecting her social interactions Bru maintains his explosive enthusiasm while being \u0026ldquo;managed\u0026rdquo; by the more responsible party members Elspeth serves as a voice of reason and technical expertise Loot \u0026amp; Items Acquired # Portal-Closing Amulet (given to Red by Eleanor) Demon Finger (trophy from the portal battle) Quilted Blankets (gifts from Magnolia) Zeke\u0026rsquo;s Journal (crucial evidence of the murder and espionage) Hallucinogenic Herbs (Zeke\u0026rsquo;s stash) Ongoing Plot Threads # Zeke\u0026rsquo;s Escape: The murderer of Red\u0026rsquo;s parents has fled toward Eldora George\u0026rsquo;s Search: Following the Pilgrim\u0026rsquo;s Path to find Olivia\u0026rsquo;s grandson The Artificial Moon: Ongoing concerns about the Eldoran Empire\u0026rsquo;s fake moon Caravan Contract: 200 gold expense and time pressure to complete the pilgrimage Portal Network: The amulet suggests more infernal rifts may need closing Milstrom\u0026rsquo;s Government: The town\u0026rsquo;s political future remains undecided Session Themes # This session expertly balanced investigation, character development, and world-building while advancing multiple plot threads. The accidental destruction of evidence added tension and consequences to the party\u0026rsquo;s actions, while the revelation about Red\u0026rsquo;s parents provided crucial backstory development. The session maintained the campaign\u0026rsquo;s blend of serious moments and comedic interactions, particularly around party dynamics and substance use.\nThe title \u0026ldquo;Burning Down the House\u0026rdquo; perfectly captures both the literal house fire and the metaphorical burning down of Red\u0026rsquo;s understanding of his family\u0026rsquo;s fate, making this a memorable and impactful session in the campaign\u0026rsquo;s narrative arc.\n","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-13/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party closes the portal, decides Frankie\u0026rsquo;s fate, and investigates Red\u0026rsquo;s family history with explosive consequences.","title":"Session 13: Burning down the house","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Into the Dark Woods # The session begins with technical difficulties as the party prepares to pursue the Omega Wolfotron that has just dragged Magnolia Redguard into the forest. Jasper \u0026ldquo;Red\u0026rdquo; Gaines activates his Large Form ability, growing to 12 feet tall, and immediately darts into the woods after the wolves, driven by determination to rescue Magnolia despite having no particular attachment to her.\nUsing his survival skills in the darkness, Red manages to pick up a blood trail despite the challenging conditions. The trail shows broken branches and blood splatters leading deeper into the woods, though the pace makes it difficult to catch up quickly.\nThe Pack Gathers # The rest of the party quickly mobilizes to follow Red\u0026rsquo;s pursuit:\nSilas Fairbanks takes a moment to be healed by Retired Detective Olivia Cooper before rushing after Red Felonias Bru and Silas ride on the back of Olivia\u0026rsquo;s summoned goat for speed Elspeth Cooper and Helisanna follow on foot, with Elspeth considering riding her steel defender BoxBox Red casts a light cantrip above himself, creating a beacon for the others to follow The party converges as they track the wolves deeper into the forest, with the goat-mounted riders able to keep pace with Red\u0026rsquo;s enhanced speed.\nWolf Negotiations # Upon reaching a clearing, the party discovers three wolves surrounding what appears to be Magnolia\u0026rsquo;s badly injured body. The confrontation quickly becomes complex when Helisanna casts Command on the alpha wolf, forcing it to approach. This reveals that the wolf can walk on two legs and shows clear signs of intelligence.\nSilas attempts to communicate with the wolves and realizes through an insight check that they possess unusual intelligence. Using his Psychic Blades telepathic connection, he establishes communication with the alpha wolf, who reveals himself to be Frankie - a werewolf who transforms between human and wolf form.\nAn Unlikely Alliance # Through Silas\u0026rsquo;s telepathic link (which he shares with Red and Elspeth), the party learns crucial information:\nFrankie and his pack have been driven to attack the town due to food scarcity caused by devils corrupting the forest The devils have been taking wolves as well as humans There\u0026rsquo;s a shrine in the woods that has been compromised by devil activity Frankie is reluctant to eat humans, finding it disturbing Elspeth steps forward to negotiate, using her natural diplomatic instincts despite her lack of charisma training. Through persuasion and the promise of healing, the party successfully recruits Frankie as an ally. Red heals both Frankie and another injured wolf, cementing their alliance.\nRetired Detective Olivia Cooper heroically wrestles Magnolia away from one of the wolves in a display of impressive athletics, showcasing her \u0026ldquo;water aerobics\u0026rdquo; training to great effect.\nPreparing for War # The party stabilizes and heals Magnolia, bringing her back to consciousness. However, they face a dilemma about what to do with her, as she\u0026rsquo;s technically a communist revolutionary scheduled to execute an innocent woman. After debate about tying her to a tree or bringing her along, they ultimately decide to send her back to town on Olivia\u0026rsquo;s summoned goat.\nFrankie explains that while he\u0026rsquo;d like to bring his pack to fight the devils, they\u0026rsquo;re too frightened after suffering heavy losses. He agrees to accompany the party alone, warning them that time is limited as his transformation won\u0026rsquo;t last indefinitely.\nThe party takes a short rest to recover, with Helisanna providing bardic inspiration to Silas, Elspeth, and Red using her musical abilities. Bru notably doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive inspiration, continuing their playful antagonistic relationship.\nThe Corrupted Shrine # The party approaches a cavern marked by glowing red runic symbols along the stone walls. Red and Olivia, with their divine connections, feel the strong presence of infernal corruption emanating from the area. The group decides on a stealthy approach rather than charging in.\nRolling an impressive group stealth check (with Silas achieving a remarkable total of 30), the party successfully infiltrates the cavern undetected. They discover a massive chamber containing:\nFour figures: Three devils positioned around a large altar, and one figure floating above it The floating figure is identified as Ophelia, an elven communist the party had previously captured and released Red\u0026rsquo;s exceptional religion check (natural 20, total 25) allows him to identify the three devil types: a healer, a damage dealer, and a tank Red recognizes the ritual taking place as one that will strengthen the devils\u0026rsquo; hold on this reality, making immediate action necessary.\nDevil Combat - Opening Moves # Initiative Order: Red (17), Silas (16), Elspeth (15), Frankie (14), Bru (12), Helisanna (8), Olivia (6)\nThe party gets the jump on the devils, launching their assault:\nRed begins by casting Emboldening Bond, connecting Silas, Helisanna, and (reluctantly) Bru with divine energy that allows them to add d4 to their rolls.\nSilas moves to engage the healer devil, throwing daggers with sneak attack damage despite rolling poorly on damage dice. His Vex weapon mastery ensures his follow-up attack will have advantage.\nElspeth charges in with BoxBox, positioning her steel defender to protect allies while attempting diplomacy one final time. When this fails, she attacks the minor devil with her gun, landing one hit out of multiple attempts.\nFrankie proves his worth immediately, delivering a devastating critical hit with his bite and claw attacks against the brute devil, dealing significant damage and establishing himself as a valuable ally.\nBru attempts to use Color Spray on the brute but discovers the devil has too many hit points for the spell to take effect. The devil merely enjoys the colorful display.\nHelisanna tries Tasha\u0026rsquo;s Hideous Laughter on the minor devil but fails to overcome its wisdom save despite using cutting words to modify the roll.\nOlivia charges the minor devil with her battle axe, landing a solid hit enhanced by Divine Smite for radiant damage, though failing to knock the devil prone with her Topple weapon mastery.\nDevil Retaliation # The devils respond with devastating area-of-effect attacks:\nThe Infernal Ravager releases a massive hellfire explosion in a 20-foot radius, forcing dexterity saves from most of the party. The 27 fire damage (half on successful save) severely injures multiple party members:\nSeveral party members fail their saves and take full damage Red uses his Stone\u0026rsquo;s Endurance racial ability to reduce some damage The party\u0026rsquo;s health pools are significantly depleted The Brute devil attacks Frankie with multiple strikes while emanating necrotic damage to nearby creatures, further wearing down the party.\nThe Minor Devil attempts to inflict bane on nearby enemies and tries to corrupt allies while healing itself and the brute for substantial amounts.\nMid-Combat Healing and Recovery # Red recognizes the dire situation and uses his Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace, allowing him to move his full distance while healing any creature within 5 feet during his movement. This strategic ability lets him heal multiple party members:\nSilas receives healing dice Olivia gets healed from near-death Bru and Helisanna also benefit from the divine healing Red supplements this with Healing Word on himself, demonstrating the crucial role of battlefield healing.\nHowever, the Ravager follows up with another area explosion, dealing 27 fire damage again and downing both Olivia and Frankie, showing just how deadly these devil encounters can be.\nTurning the Tide # The party rallies with impressive teamwork:\nSilas eliminates the Infernal Ravager with precise dagger throws, using his advantage from Vex and dealing substantial sneak attack damage in a cinematic jumping attack over Elspeth.\nElspeth rushes to revive Olivia, throwing herself protectively over the fallen paladin while using her healing abilities. BoxBox provides consistent damage against the remaining devils.\nBru finally gets his Eldritch Cannon back online (having been without it due to no long rest), deploying a Force Ballista that provides both consistent damage and tactical positioning with its push effect.\nHelisanna shifts to her Warlock abilities, casting Hex and then Eldritch Blast with devastating effect, landing a critical hit that eliminates the Minor Devil with a spectacular display of force energy.\nFinal Confrontation # With only the Brute devil remaining, the party focuses fire:\nOlivia, revived and furious, channels her Divine Strike and Imbued Weapon abilities to deal massive radiant damage. Her attacks cut through the devil \u0026ldquo;like infernal butter,\u0026rdquo; showcasing the devastating effectiveness of paladin abilities against fiends.\nFrankie, despite being knocked unconscious and briefly reverting to human form, proves his mettle throughout the fight with consistent high damage.\nThe final devil falls to Olivia\u0026rsquo;s righteous fury as she delivers the killing blow, demonstrating the \u0026ldquo;bloodthirsty Olivia\u0026rdquo; persona that emerges when fighting evil.\nResolution and Aftermath # As the devils die, their blood and energy flow into the altar\u0026rsquo;s symbols, briefly intensifying the ritual around Ophelia. Just as the situation seems to worsen, Eleanor arrives with perfect timing, raising her amulet and beginning a cleansing chant.\nEleanor\u0026rsquo;s divine magic successfully purifies the shrine, causing:\nThe devil bodies to disintegrate completely The ritual to be disrupted and reversed The shrine\u0026rsquo;s corruption to be cleansed The forest\u0026rsquo;s natural balance to begin restoration Character Moments and Development # The session showcases significant character development:\nRed emerges as a crucial support character, his divine healing abilities proving essential for party survival. His religious knowledge also proves invaluable for understanding the threats they face.\nOlivia displays a fierce protective instinct and righteous fury against evil, establishing her as a formidable frontline fighter when her divine abilities are properly utilized.\nElspeth continues her role as the party\u0026rsquo;s heart, rushing to help fallen allies and attempting diplomatic solutions even in dire circumstances.\nSilas demonstrates tactical thinking and adaptability, using his psychic abilities for communication and his combat skills for precise strikes.\nBru struggles without his signature abilities but adapts by working with his cannon and providing what support he can.\nHelisanna shows her versatility by switching between bard and warlock abilities as the situation demands.\nTechnical and Strategic Notes # The combat showcases several important D\u0026amp;D mechanics:\nThe effectiveness of area healing abilities in emergency situations The devastating power of coordinated area-of-effect attacks from enemies The importance of tactical positioning and teamwork The value of having diverse damage types and abilities The power scaling of higher-level play with more impactful abilities The party\u0026rsquo;s recruitment of Frankie demonstrates creative problem-solving and the potential benefits of turning enemies into allies through roleplay rather than combat.\nConclusion # The session ends with the immediate threat resolved but the party significantly depleted. They\u0026rsquo;ve successfully:\nRescued Magnolia (though sending her away) Cleansed the corrupted shrine Eliminated the devil threat Restored balance to the forest Gained a powerful werewolf ally The victory comes at a cost, with most party members badly injured and resources depleted, setting up the need for significant rest and recovery before their next adventure. The successful completion of this dangerous mission demonstrates the party\u0026rsquo;s growing effectiveness as a team and their ability to handle serious supernatural threats.\nThe episode title \u0026ldquo;Out of the frying pan, into the Fire\u0026rdquo; proves prophetic, as the party moves from the dangerous wolf encounter directly into an even more perilous devil confrontation, barely surviving through teamwork, tactical thinking, and a bit of luck.\n","date":"26 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-12/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party pursues werewolves, recruits an unlikely ally, and faces their most dangerous battle yet.","title":"Session Twelve: Out of the frying pan, into the Fire","type":"sessions"},{"content":" 🕳️ Descent into the Tunnels # The session begins where the last left off: the party is led by Roscoe into a hidden series of tunnels beneath the town—once used to smuggle pilgrims of Tyr toward the mountain pass. They arrive at a meadery and dining hall where Roscoe cryptically offers to share “all of his secrets” if the party will drink his specially made Everclear: a magically potent potato alcohol distilled to purity. Before they can fully orient themselves, Roscoe sends Red a telepathic message asking, “Do you trust your compatriots?”\nThe message throws Red into confusion. Speaking aloud, he unsettles the group, who believe he may be hearing voices again. Silas connects himself, Red, and Bru into a psychic mind link to investigate further. Red continues to think out loud, and the group debates whether he’s genuinely dimwitted or just unfiltered. This initiates a series of multi-layered conversations—some aloud, some telepathic, some psychic side-chats—that begins to unravel the social trust and mystery around Roscoe’s true nature.\n🧪 The Everclear Test # Roscoe clarifies that the psychic message was from him, but takes great delight in misleading the party. He offers to reveal the truth about Red’s past—but only if they all drink with him. What follows is a half-hour-long peer-pressure sequence in which each party member reluctantly takes shots of Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s Everclear.\nBru demands the alcohol be “brown” and attempts to add dirt. Roscoe fiercely objects to “tainting” his purity. Bru finally drinks the clear liquor and secretly pours dirt into his mouth mid-sip, proudly proclaiming “It was brown in my mouth.” Silas, skeptical and unimpressed, drinks without fanfare and remains steady. Helisanna drinks and holds her own despite the alcohol’s nearly caustic potency. Red, who is canonically not a drinker, is caught in a vortex of social pressure, shame, and curiosity. After being peer pressured from every direction, he drinks—with dirt added mid-sip—and is immediately inebriated but jovial. Elspeth and Olivia offer dry commentary, with Olivia eventually healing Red post-binge with Lesser Restoration. 📖 Red’s True Identity Revealed # Once Red drinks, Roscoe gives him a journal belonging to his mother, Marion Cross. The journal, which Red reads aloud to himself while crying in the tunnels beneath his childhood home, reveals staggering truths:\nRed is adopted, which most of the party already suspected. His real name is Thurnok Skyhammer, and he is a Goliath prince from the Skyhammer clan. His parents were not random pilgrims—they were placed in hiding by the Twilight Company to protect Red from the Eldoran Empire. The Crosses raised him in secret and were likely murdered, not taken by illness as the town claimed. The emotional weight of the journal devastates Red, who is wrestling with revelations about his identity, lineage, and the loss of his adoptive family. He remains in a dissociative daze, eventually retreating into his childhood room—which has been stripped and desecrated by squatters.\n👮 Interrogation of the Intruders # While Red reads and processes his identity crisis, the rest of the party turns their attention to the two interlopers who have taken over his family home: Ophelia (an elven woman) and Doc (an orc male). After incapacitating them in a surprise attack, the party handcuffs the duo, ties them to chairs, and begins an extended interrogation.\nOlivia takes the lead, using her former detective persona to extract truths. Silas summons his psychic daggers and threatens to implant their worst memories in their minds—a dark and unsettling turn that proves effective. The captives reveal that the town has fallen under control of the Milstrom Party, a cult-like communist faction led by a mysterious figure known as Red Lennon. They admit that monthly sacrifices are made at an old druidic shrine in the forest to “keep Red Lennon happy.” Red Lennon\u0026rsquo;s power appears supernatural—capable of cursing the town if not appeased. The shrine is believed to be connected to a portal, and only those with red armbands (like the captives) are allowed to witness the rituals. Once they extract all they can, the party knocks the two out again and—fully in line with their chaotic alignment—throws the captives, still in their chairs, into the Bag of Holding.\n🐺 Attack of the Wolves # The moment of catharsis is shattered by sounds of screaming and chaos outside. Wolves—massive, intelligent, and terrifying—have descended upon the town. Roscoe warns the group with his usual ambiguous flair, but the danger is immediate.\nThe party emerges from the tunnel into the basement of the Common Mug inn, shoving through a barricade to find townsfolk in full panic. Five wolves are actively assaulting townspeople and attempting to break into the inn. In the chaos, Red spots a massive dire wolf dragging a screaming woman (Magnolia Redguard) into the woods.\n⚔️ The Battle in the Streets # The group launches into an intense urban skirmish:\nHelisanna draws her axe (her Pact Weapon) and cleaves wolves down in close combat. Bru unleashes a Thunderwave spell, blasting wolves back and doing significant area damage. Silas uses psychic daggers to devastating effect, using sneak attacks and stealth to outmaneuver foes. Olivia engages with her divine smite and battle axe, applying pressure to the strongest wolves. Elspeth and BoxBox coordinate ranged and melee strikes to great effect, wounding multiple wolves at once. Red uses Balm of Peace and healing magic to keep the party alive while also psychically spiraling from the revelations of his parentage and the sound of Magnolia\u0026rsquo;s screams fading into silence. After the brutal brawl, the wolves retreat—but not before leaving behind wounded townsfolk and a shaken party. Red is left grappling with the knowledge that Magnolia, who supposedly witnessed his parents’ murder, may now be dead or worse.\n🧠 Character Arcs \u0026amp; Emotional Shifts # Red / Thurnok Skyhammer: Moves from naïve foundling to a potentially displaced prince with a traumatic past and dangerous destiny. Roscoe: Grows even more enigmatic. His combination of cryptic wisdom, drunken philosophical waxing, and unsettling honesty keeps the party on edge. He seems deeply invested in Red’s awakening. Silas: Leans further into his morally grey persona, using psychic threats and back-alley tactics for results. He becomes Red’s unspoken guardian as things unravel. Helisanna: Balances chaotic humor with raw power, revealing her musical and magical fury in equal measure. Olivia: Anchors the team with lawful conviction, but begins to blur lines with her intimidating methods. Elspeth: Keeps calm and focused, contributing significantly to the battle and showing her capability as a reliable support and damage dealer. Bru: Continues to play the wildcard—blending bombs, humor, and a taste for destruction while subtly showing care for Red and the group. 🧩 Loose Threads # Magnolia Redguard has been dragged away by wolves. Her fate is unknown. She may be the only person who witnessed Red’s parents\u0026rsquo; death. Willemay, the dissenting voice in town, is still scheduled for execution within a few hours. Red Lennon’s role as both political leader and magical threat has yet to be addressed. The Druidic Shrine—long known to be a place of power—is possibly a portal, a blight source, and the focal point of the cult’s activities. Roscoe’s nature remains suspicious. He may be a warforged Peaceforged soldier, once part of a psychic hive-mind led by a being named SHIELD. 📜 Memorable Quotes # “It was brown in my mouth.” – Bru, after spiking his Everclear with dirt\n“You know, Roscoe, I don’t really drink…” – Red, just before spiraling into identity collapse\n“I am a liar. And I can also be a hypocrite.” – Roscoe\n“You’re giving me mildly autistic vibes in a creepy way.” – Olivia, to Roscoe\n“Roscoe’s Everclear: You Only Live Once.” – Roscoe, marketing his drink\n“Everything about Red’s life is a lie.” – Roscoe\n🏁 Session End # The wolves are driven off. The townspeople cheer the party’s heroism, but the weight of what was uncovered still hangs heavy:\nRed has a new name, a forgotten kingdom, and a lost inheritance. A friend who could shed light on his parents may be dead. A sacrificial cult runs the town. And time is running out before Willemay is executed. The party stands at a crossroads, caught between heroism, revenge, and revolution.\nNext stop: the shrine—and maybe Red Lennon.\n","date":"19 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-11/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party drinks Roscoe’s Everclear and uncovers Red’s royal past while wolves descend on the town","title":"Session Eleven: You Only Live Once","type":"sessions"},{"content":" ❖ Recap of Previous Events # The party had escaped High Forge and began traveling with a large caravan. They met Eleanor’s Wandering Coven, got introduced to a magic guild, and helped Fred, who now provides them with info. Fred brought them the case of Bori, a boy in a coma due to a deal made with a mysterious entity named Crawley. The party retrieved a fox totem from a shrine after solving a moonlight puzzle and fighting a guardian, then gave it to Crawley. Bori and his family recovered. ❖ Journey Toward Milstrom # The caravan travels along a blighted, eerie landscape toward Milstrom. At a crossroads, the party meets two intimidating Eldoran Knights warning travelers to avoid Milstrom. The knights say the town has changed, hinting at dangerous, mind-affecting forces. The party, citing numerous quests tied to Milstrom, decides to proceed despite warnings. ❖ Context for Milstrom # The group lists their reasons for entering Milstrom:\nA blight affecting Eleanor’s shrine. The mystery surrounding the mayor’s disappearance and rumors of a political collective. The last known location of Finnegan and George (Project Purple Patch). A potential portal to hell. Red\u0026rsquo;s personal ties: family history and suspected involvement of the Twilight Company. Possible show venue for Hellasana at the Common Mug tavern. ❖ Enter: The Food Truck Clubhouse \u0026amp; Party Debate # The party discusses tactics (talking vs. explosions) in their crowded food truck, full of allies and passengers. Political and social topics emerge, including the status of tieflings, who are recent hellspawn refugees, and commentary on racial/species mechanics in D\u0026amp;D. The party debates decision-making processes and considers votes, brute strength, and past combat performance. ❖ Arrival at Milstrom # They talk their way past the Eldoran Knights checkpoint with Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s help, receiving a brooch to report back with findings. The town appears unusually orderly and proud. The forest is blighted, and the townspeople wear red armbands. The Common Mug tavern is the social center. There are no street vendors or signs of a typical free market economy. Tobias the blacksmith mentions a collectivist movement led by someone named Red Linen. ❖ Meet Roscoe # The party meets Roscoe, a bizarre old Warforged with a makeshift digestive system from wish magic. Roscoe, clearly eccentric and alcoholic, offers valuable knowledge in exchange for beer—a lot of it. The party stealthily steals a keg from the tavern while the town holds a public trial. ❖ Show Trial at the Common Mug # The party witnesses a chilling communist-style public tribunal. A woman named Willemay Hargreave is sentenced to execution at dawn for “counter-revolutionary activity.” Her accusations: questioning Red Linen’s regime and warning about creeping authoritarianism. ❖ Tunnels and Revelations # In exchange for the keg, Roscoe reveals: A hidden trapdoor that leads to tunnels beneath Milstrom, used by pilgrims to avoid the town. Directions to the corrupted shrine, detailed via a drunkenly hand-drawn but decipherable map. Information about Willemay’s dissent and religious alignment (devoted to Tyr). Confirmation that the town is under subtle magical corruption stemming from Red Linen—a literal devil from hell. Insights about Olivia\u0026rsquo;s nephew Finnegan and George, who passed through these tunnels in pursuit of a pilgrimage. ❖ The Pilgrim Route and Next Steps # The party uses Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s tunnels and map to plan their approach. They face moral quandaries: Should they intervene in Willemay’s execution? Can they defeat Red Linen and break his corruptive influence on the town? Olivia and Elspeth reflect on familial ties and motivations. Roscoe encourages them to act quickly, warning of Red Linen’s hold on the town’s morality and politics. Notable NPCs Introduced # Roscoe – A drunken Warforged with a self-modified digestive system, deep knowledge of the town, and tragic yet comedic undertones. Tobias – Friendly blacksmith, neutral on politics. Willemay Hargreave – Elven woman and outspoken dissenter sentenced to execution. Red Linen – Devilish communist leader corrupting Milstrom from behind the scenes. Eldoran Knights – Cautious guards stationed outside Milstrom. Key Threads Moving Forward # Investigate and potentially cleanse the shrine causing the blight. Stop Willemay’s execution and uncover more about Red Linen’s control. Use underground tunnels for stealth and recon. Follow leads regarding Finnegan, George, and Project Purple Patch. Maintain faction reputation and balance public-facing actions with the risk of exposure.

After a restful night, a new supernatural mystery involving a comatose child draws the party eastward into the woods and deeper into the realms of fae influence.\nParty Members Present # Helisanna – Human Bard/Warlock Elspeth Cooper – Dwarf Battlesmith Artificer/Paladin Felonias \u0026ldquo;Bru\u0026rdquo; Bru – Goblin Artillerist Artificer Retired Detective Olivia Cooper – Dwarf Devotion Paladin Red – Absent PC played by another player (healer) Silas – Remains asleep, not part of the night’s excursion Plot Events # A Midnight Emergency # Fred the gopher (from previous sessions) bursts into camp seeking Red\u0026rsquo;s healing help. A child in the camp, Bori, has mysteriously fallen into a coma the same night his mother, Sela, awakened from her months-long coma. Olivia, Elspeth, and Red respond, leaving the rest asleep. Grogi, a friend of Bori’s, recounts that the boys met a “weird man in a white suit and top hat” in the woods the day before, who offered to \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo; Bori’s mother in exchange for a trade. Olivia uses Divine Sense and detects a faint trace of evil on Bori but not on his mother. Gathering the Team # Olivia wakes Helisanna and Bru without alerting Silas. Silas remains asleep in the van. The group agrees to investigate the mysterious encounter from the day before. Red’s medical check confirms that healing won’t help Bori—his state is magical in nature. Into the Woods # The Crossroads Encounter # Following Grogi’s directions, the party ventures into the eerie eastern woods under moonlight, accompanied by Red. At a crossroads, they hear humming—“Pop Goes the Weasel”—followed by the poem “The Tyger” by William Blake. A fae named Mr. Crowley appears: white suit, opera mask, pointy teeth, charming yet disturbing. He confirms he struck a deal with Bori, who gave up his own consciousness to save his mother’s life. Crowley offers a new deal: retrieve a fox-shaped fae totem from an ancient shrine in exchange for restoring Bori’s consciousness without reverting Sela back into her coma. Journey to the Shrine # The Midnight Pool # Guided by a magical mote of light Crowley provides, the party finds a hidden shrine in the heart of the woods. They uncover a dry celestial pool surrounded by old mirrors. When moonlight is properly reflected using the mirrors, a hidden staircase opens beneath the pool. Guardian of the Shrine # Within the shrine, they find the totem on a fallen pedestal. As Helisanna approaches, a skeletal bear with ram’s horns and green fire eyes emerges. A battle ensues: Bru and Red\u0026rsquo;s fire spells are particularly effective. Olivia and Boxbox (Elspeth’s steel defender) make a strong defensive duo, using reactions to deflect attacks. Elspeth and Helisanna contribute with ranged and melee attacks. The bear is destroyed after Olivia lands a devastating smite attack. The Decision # Helisanna picks up the totem. Elspeth uses Identify and confirms it’s a powerful conjuration-linked item: a Fae anchor for the spirit known as Tunlak. A ritual could potentially summon Tunlak, but the components are unknown. The group debates whether to give the totem to Crowley, fearing long-term consequences. Ultimately, they choose to honor the deal. Return to Crowley # Crowley appears at the crossroads, genuinely pleased. He accepts the totem and assures them Bori will awaken and he will leave the area in peace. Helisanna shakes his hand, sealing the deal. Crowley vanishes into the earth, leaving only his smile lingering in the air. Epilogue # Back at the refugee camp, the party sees the family joyfully reunited: Bori, Sela, and Turek are all awake and well. Olivia warns Hoboken (the monk of Steyr) to spread word about Crowley and to warn others against making fae bargains. The party ends the night wary but victorious—having saved a child’s life, made a deal with a devilish fae, and unleashed possible consequences for the future. Notable Roleplay Moments # Crowley’s eerie charm and poetic cadence adds gravitas to the fae bargain. Helisanna’s playful yet bold nature shines during her interactions with Crowley and her curiosity around the totem. Olivia’s legalistic, justice-focused objection to fae deals adds moral weight. Elspeth’s utility and coordination with Boxbox make her a tactical powerhouse. Bru’s love of fire causes a few forest fires, humorously downplayed. Red’s support spells and pacifist nature play a quiet but critical role. Themes # Moral ambiguity: Should a deal with a fae be upheld for a good outcome? Innocence and cost: A child’s sacrifice underscores the theme of exploitation. Choices and consequences: The long-term effect of giving Crowley what he wants remains unclear.

As they rejoin a larger caravan of fleeing citizens and merchants, the group maintains a low profile while still accompanied by Bo, the Twilight Company remnants, and the now-painted vehicles: Vroomfall and Zoomfall.\nVan aesthetics update: Vroomfall now features the iconic “Three Steve Moon” (wolves wearing sunglasses) howling at a stylized moon. Zoomfall is painted in a Mad Max–inspired style, waiting on Ellie’s final flair. 🧪 A Wave of Revelations # The session opens with a retrospective on Silas’ backstory:\nSilas and Bru were once part of a gang that stole a powerful artifact from the criminal syndicate The Iron Claws. The stolen item is a glass orb containing a dragon, which is extremely dangerous if mishandled (e.g. stored in a Bag of Holding). The Iron Claws are now actively pursuing Silas by name—meaning his current identity has been compromised. Other shocking reveals include:\nOlivia’s family cat, Bodega, is implicated in drug smuggling—using produce to transport a dangerous eye-drop drug called \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo;. Olivia is devastated to learn her local bodega may have been a front for narcotics. 💰 Loot Recap \u0026amp; Equipment Shopping # The group discusses gold totals:\nEveryone received 2,000g, contributed 666g each for a Bag of Holding, leaving 1,334g remaining per player. Olivia, Elspeth, and others consider what items to buy. Common and uncommon items are approved. Clarifications about heavy armor proficiencies are made, especially with updated 2024 rules. Healing potions are recommended for low-slot clerics. 🌄 Traveling Toward Milstrom # The party travels with the caravan toward Milstrom, Red\u0026rsquo;s hometown.\nBo questions what’s next for him after High Forge. Olivia tries to keep him on the moral path. Silas confesses he\u0026rsquo;s rattled that his “clean” identity was discovered by the Iron Claws. The party confirms the town\u0026rsquo;s name is Milstrom, though it takes a while to recall. 🛑 Paladin Encounter: Religious Persecution # A disturbing road encounter introduces Eldoran paladins—human knights wielding weapons and armor embedded with violaceous crystals (the same material powering Elspeth’s racer).\nThey are forcing refugees to swear allegiance to Empress Eldora, demanding abandonment of their former gods. A knight accosts a dwarven monk who refuses to forsake Tyr. Olivia, Elspeth, and Red intervene—Olivia tries diplomacy, Elspeth supports, and Silas pretends she’s a senile grandma to de-escalate. Silas rolls a 29 deception, diffusing the situation. The monk, named Hoboken, joins the caravan under the party’s protection. ⛺ Campsite Revelations and Side Missions # The caravan stops for the night at a seasonal festival site turned refugee camp. Players pursue side activities:\nHelisanna # Drinks with caravan guards and trades stories about the dragons and Eldoran knights. Learns of another caravan approaching with more paladins a day behind them. Red # Performs triage on injured refugees, healing a severely burned boy using Healing Word. Befriends the boy’s father, Frederick, who insists on repaying the party by joining them and offering his services. Silas # Takes Frederick under his wing, probing him for intelligence. Learns that Project Purple Patch, a mysterious effort related to missing Tyr pilgrims, seems centered around Milstrom. Confirms that Red’s family was likely involved in the coven—raising more mystery around their deaths. Discusses promoting another Hellasana concert to earn gold. Elspeth # Acquires 20 spare car parts from Trevor, a mechanic merchant. Silas negotiates a sponsorship deal for discounted parts in exchange for promoting Trevor’s brand. 🧭 Arrival of Tien \u0026amp; Tiefling Lore Drop # The party meets Tien, their employer from the Steven Guild.\nTien reveals that his entire family are Tiefling refugees from Avernus, having escaped through a rift in the mountains. This is the first canon introduction of Tieflings into the world—players are stunned. The family brought wealth and skills with them, earning a place in society and launching a merchant operation. 📜 Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s Offer: The Blight and the Hearth Seed # The party is approached by Eleanor, a halfling hedge mage from Eleanor’s Wandering Coven:\nShe asks for help taking a Hearth Seed to a Druidic Altar near Milstrom to counteract a mysterious blight affecting the area. She implies that this may be linked to deeper corruption or the nearby hell rift. Red is visibly disturbed—his hometown is falling apart. 📋 The Milstrom To-Do List # The session ends with the party compiling a running list of objectives in Milstrom:\nInvestigate the blight and help restore the Druidic altar. Locate the hell rift and determine its threat. Investigate the disappearance of Mayor Jed Carter. Follow leads on Project Purple Patch and the missing Tyr pilgrims, possibly linked to Red’s family. Figure out the new government structure of Milstrom. Set up a Hellasana concert for funds and influence. Reconnect with Finnegan, a go-between for the Twilight Company. Fred also returns, having located 100 MP3 blanks and assisting with acquiring them for the next concert.\n🌙 Final Thoughts # The party rests under the stars as Bo\u0026rsquo;s caravan and Tien\u0026rsquo;s family merge with their group. Hellasana is drunk, Red is contemplative, Silas is scheming, and Olivia remains ever vigilant. With their next destination looming, Milstrom promises answers—but also deeper mystery and danger.\n","date":"3 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-8/","section":"Sessions","summary":"Tacocats take a moment to meet caravan folks.","title":"Session Eight: Caravan Nights","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Escape From the Race and Into the Fire # The session begins immediately after the conclusion of the race, with the party still in the Vroomfall. Suddenly, explosions are heard from the direction of the Market Ward — possibly indicating a dragon attack. The party, joined by Elspeth who loads her car into the Vroomfall, quickly debates their escape route from the city.\nPlotting a Tunnel Escape # They consider taking the old, secret tunnels beneath the city, once used by royalty and now largely forgotten. Though none of them are experts, Olivia recalls encountering smugglers who may have used the tunnels, and Bru and Silas speculate that their Twilight Company contact Victor may know a way out. However, Little Hovel, where Victor might be, is in the Market Ward — the area currently under siege.\nWith no better options, the party resolves to head toward the chaos to rescue Victor. Olivia also remembers that Bodega, her great-grandson, is at her apartment, which is along the way.\nDriving Into the Market Ward # They begin the drive into the Market Ward against the flow of traffic. Guards at the gate are shocked but let them through. As they enter, they see dragons dive-bombing buildings, fireballs raining down, and a glowing golden magical dome protecting thousands of citizens. Jasper spots golden-armored soldiers forming this protective bubble using connected crystal shields — not High Forge soldiers, possibly Eldoran in origin.\nPicking Up Victor and Bodega # In the chaos, Elspeth is sent to retrieve Bodega separately. The rest of the party drives to Little Hovel, dodging dragon fire via group dexterity saves (blessed and bard-inspired), taking fire damage along the way. They finally find Victor, frantically trying to rescue a mix of essential and ridiculous items — including Girl Scout cookies, a piranha gun, and a folder of old tunnel maps (which he does not realize are valuable).\nVictor is roped into the van and interrogated. He reveals he doesn’t know the tunnels himself but has the folder full of mining routes — potentially useful to navigate out. Olivia grabs it, and the group continues the escape.\nMore Fire, More Problems # Another fireball comes close, prompting another save. Red casts Prayer of Healing to top up the injured party. As they head back toward the gate to exit the Market Ward, one dragon clamps onto it, partially holding it open. The party debates using distractions and illusions to slip by. They attempt a combo: Helisanna casts Minor Illusion of a golden knight while Bru fires his Force Ballista. The illusion nearly works, but the dragon sees through it and retaliates.\nA successful round of saves and creative buffs lets them survive the hit. Red lays on hands to keep people stable. They blast through the gate — just barely making it as the dragon claws into the Great Hall.\nInto the Mines # Inside the now-empty Great Hall, the party heads for the mine entrance. They hear Victor’s sending stone ring and eavesdrop on a call from Twilight Company associate Mira, who informs them the Iron Claws gang is controlling tunnel access and charging fees. Olivia realizes that Helja Ungart, the gang\u0026rsquo;s leader, is an old nemesis who would definitely recognize her — and Silas too, who is now revealed to have stolen a mysterious object from her.\nThe Stolen Orb # Silas produces a swirling, galaxy-filled glass orb, the object of the heist that cost his former crew their lives. Victor calls it a communication device to another plane or being. Olivia touches it — sees a cosmic dragon-like being, and hears it speak her name. She takes psychic damage but learns it knows her deeply.\nThe party debates where to hide the orb, almost placing it in the bag of holding before recalling that could risk catastrophic dimensional collapse. It\u0026rsquo;s safely returned to a regular pack.\nPlans and Disguises # At the aquafarm near the tunnel entrance, they rendezvous with Bodega and the Twilight Company crew (Cyrus, Mira, Lanny, Courtney). The party prepares to sneak past the Iron Claws with a multi-layered plan:\nPaint the Vroomfall to disguise it. Use disguise kits on the more recognizable members. Hide Red and Silas in the bag of holding (without the orb). Hide Helisanna, Elspeth, and Brew in produce crates. During prep, they discover the Twilight Company\u0026rsquo;s crates are full of an illegal drug called \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo; — a red liquid taken as eyedrops. Olivia demands they abandon the cargo or use it as bribe material. Lanny and Courtney reluctantly agree and sink the crates in the hydroponic lake.\nCrossing the Checkpoint # With all disguises prepped, Olivia leads the caravan to the checkpoint, supported by Bo. A tough negotiation ensues with the Iron Claw thugs, who demand 500 gold. Olivia successfully persuades them to accept 450, and the party moves through safely.\nThe Long March and Freedom # They drive for hours through guarded tunnel paths, finally emerging onto the other side of the mountain under a sky of stars. The escape is successful. Victor is overjoyed; Olivia sternly warns Bo this is his one and only pass for getting involved in crime.\nEndgame and Reflections # The party plans to continue toward their next job. Loose ends:\nThe orb is powerful and mysterious — potentially a link to a divine being or dragon. Silas has a bounty on his head and a past with Helja. Olivia’s grandson is still missing, and their journey will lead them closer to that mystery. Red, Helisanna, and Elspeth all have reasons to move forward toward the next city. As the session ends, they prepare to meet their escort at the upcoming rendezvous point, disguises intact, dragon behind them, and dangers still ahead.\nNotable Character Developments:\nOlivia: Uses Lay on Hands, leads negotiations, and interacts with the orb, gaining direct contact with a cosmic dragon. Silas: Revealed to be the target of a major gang due to a heist; hides in the bag of holding. Bru: Leans into criminal connections, provides artillery distraction. Red: Uses key cleric support spells (Bless, Emboldening Bond, Prayer of Healing). Elspeth \u0026amp; Helisanna: Though more in the background, actively involved in crate disguise and navigating escape. New Factions Introduced:\nGolden Knights: Mysterious, Eldoran-associated figures who protect civilians from dragon attacks using a magical shield. Iron Claws: Ruthless gang led by Helja Ungart, charging tolls and locking down the tunnels. Victor: A Despicable Me-inspired Twilight Company techie with comic relief and potential plot utility. Items of Interest:\nThe Orb: A glass sphere linking to a cosmic dragon entity. Piranha Gun: A joke weapon pulled from Victor’s haul. Bag of Holding: Now party-owned, used to hide Silas and Red.

She connects its sudden closure to the disappearance of a local figure and the growing dragon threat. She then visits Bodega, who is also shutting down his shop due to fear of approaching dragons. Olivia arranges for Bodega and his cat to join the group\u0026rsquo;s caravan, securing supplies and shelter. Group Reconvenes Over Breakfast # The group finally gathers and shares scattered info: dragons are real, approaching the city, and causing mass evacuations. This catches several members off guard. There is light-hearted bickering about the concert from the night before and whose actions were most impactful, with multiple characters claiming credit. Tensions briefly rise between Silas and Brew, and Helisanna is teased for her subpar performance. Planning for the Race # The group solidifies roles in the upcoming underground street race: Elspeth will drive the Doomfall. BoxBox (her automaton) rides in the back for support. Silas and Helisanna prepare sabotage and distraction tactics. Brew equips and plans the use of flamethrower cannons and caltrops. Red and Olivia offer support roles including healing, driving, and cannon operation. Tactical positions and sabotage plans are laid out, including: Trapping the narrow tunnel with caltrops (Silas). Stationing Helisanna at a key hairpin turn. Using flamethrower turrets mounted on the van. Olivia staying atop the van as mobile cannon support. Final Pre-Race Errands # Elspeth visits rival racer Divald to exchange small talk and gather intel. Silas collects payment from Twilight Company for prior sabotage work. Brew attempts to steal a communal liquor bottle in a failed scheme to poison rival racers — accidentally disrupting Silas’ own sabotage plan. 🏎️ The Race Begins # Elspeth lines up with nearly 50 racers. The team’s pre-race support is visualized as a surreal, symbolic combat encounter representing “the race” as a sentient monster. Players alternate between skill checks and combat mechanics in a shared narrative framework, effectively “fighting” the dangers of the race. Skill Challenge Highlights: # Silas expertly lays caltrops in the tunnel. Olivia intimidates a goblin team into vacating a key ambush spot. Red casts buffs and support magic like Emboldening Bond. Brew fires fireworks from roof-mounted cannons to detonate landmines. Elspeth benefits from multiple buffs (Cat’s Grace, Sanctuary, Shield of Faith) while dodging traps and maintaining high speed. 💥 Combat with the \u0026ldquo;Race\u0026rdquo; # The “Race” manifests as a mechanical, mobile nightmare that targets Elspeth. The party tactically overwhelms it using positioning, teamwork, and abilities like Hex, Smite, and psychic knives. Olivia lands a decisive hit with Divine Smite. Silas and Helisanna deal significant damage, while Red and Brew offer key support. 🏁 Victory # Elspeth overtakes the final racers using a clever fake-out maneuver and finishes with a jump across the final bridge — Fast \u0026amp; Furious-style. She\u0026rsquo;s awarded first place and a membership into the underground racing circuit. Just as the dust settles, dragons begin their assault on the city. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Party Role Breakdown # Character Role in Race Contributions Elspeth Driver Won the race; dodged traps; handled the car solo.

They’re set to perform for thousands, with a lucrative 10,000 gold contract from their patron, Sandra. But the concert is just one part of the whirlwind — the illegal street race looms the next day.\nParty Preparations: # Helisana chills, channeling her inner rock star and preparing mentally for the concert. Elspeth inspects the car and the van, setting traps and preparing “BoxBox” (her steel defender) to watch the garage. She also builds a tripwire shotgun trap with an alarm spell for added security. Felonias Bru designs and installs two under-the-table pyro-cannons on either side of the concert stage — dual-purpose as fireworks and defense weapons. Total cost: 500 gold. Silas buys MP3-like “magic stones” to record the concert, investing in a recording kit and planning to resell the exclusive concert audio for profit. Red meditates, reflects, and prepares as a moral compass and on-site medic, with water-based crowd cooling ready. Olivia stays back at the garage with BoxBox, overseeing security and routine tasks. 🛠️ The Venue: Forge Heart # The Forge Heart is a legendary and archaic magma-forged anvil temple turned venue. It’s largely symbolic, with lava tubes and cavernous acoustics. The party outfits it with:\nFlame turrets Sound setups Recording systems (assembled by Elspeth) Firework launchers 🧃 Merchandising \u0026amp; Morality # Silas, ever the entrepreneur, plans to sell limited edition live recordings for 10–50 gold each. He schemes exclusivity and nostalgia-based marketing, channeling his rogue instincts into music distribution. Bru mocks the financial priorities, but secretly admires the hustle.\n💣 The Attack at the Show # Just before the show starts, Elspeth spots three suspicious dwarf-sized individuals approaching Silas and Sandra (who is delivering the first 6,000g payment). Combat erupts.\nElspeth blocks the goons and gets grappled. Silas evades capture, gets stabbed, then non-lethally incapacitates one attacker with a psychic knife. Red supports with Sanctuary and Emboldening Bond. Bru launches a mortar firework from the turrets, seriously injuring a goon. Sandra is nearly robbed of the briefcase but escapes. The party captures and incapacitates all three assailants before the show even starts. Suspiciously, the goons were after Silas — not the money. 🎶 The Concert: Chaos \u0026amp; Chords # The concert is chaotic but powerful:\nStart: Initial performance is lackluster (low roll), crowd grows impatient. Middle: Bru launches massive pyrotechnics to save the vibe. Red blesses Helisana with Enhance Ability. Crowd enthusiasm grows. Finale: Glowing-eyed crowd members join the stage as backup bandmates (possibly under infernal influence). Helisana rises via harness with firework “wings,” smoke blankets the stage. Epic finale saves the night. Despite Helisana’s middling rolls, the crowd is riveted by the violence, fireworks, and demonic vibes. 🔫 Surprise Ambush #2 # As the concert ends:\nFour more enemies try to assassinate Silas during the show’s final act. A second battle erupts live on stage. Silas gets shot but evades and retaliates from the crowd. Elspeth and Red join the fight, coordinating spiritual and physical takedowns. One assassin flees as Silas fails a final shot, despite clever positioning. 💰 Post-Concert Payoff # Silas successfully sells nearly all of his MP3s for 50 gold each, netting 5,000 gold. Sandra returns with the final 3,000 gold in a heavy briefcase — but not before criticizing the lack of security. The group realizes (too late) that they were supposed to run the venue themselves. Elspeth’s garage alarm goes off. 🚨 The Garage: Another Intrusion # Silas and Elspeth race back in a taxi, discovering:\nThe alarm was triggered. Two human “tracksuited” would-be saboteurs — a brother-sister duo — are found unconscious at the garage. Elspeth’s traps and alarm successfully fended them off. The duo admits they were hired to sabotage race competitors. 🍻 Denouement # The group splits: Red and Helisana go out drinking with Bru. Silas and Elspeth secure the garage. A mysterious cloaked figure approaches Brew and Red, asking for Silas. Red lies convincingly and they vanish. The crew tallies their haul: nearly 14,250 gold, an unusual amount for such a young party. 🔍 Session Highlights # 🎤 Helisana’s evolving rock-star mystique continues to grow despite middling rolls. 💼 Silas leans deep into capitalism and espionage. 🔧 Elspeth builds, traps, and throws herself into the race prep. 🔥 Bru’s fireworks absolutely saved the concert. 🛡️ Red shines as the protector and moral center — full support mode. 🧩 Threads \u0026amp; Loose Ends # The attackers seemed to know about the payment and targeted Silas specifically. Fans with glowing purple eyes may be linked to infernal or Twilight Company activity. The mystery figure looking for Silas adds more danger to his growing notoriety. Olivia and BoxBox continue to be crucial off-screen characters. The tracksuit twins might reappear.

Party Members Present # Silas Red Hellasana Bru (later) Olivia (temporarily NPC\u0026rsquo;d) Philbin (gnome NPC, captured and interrogated) Key Events # 1. Briefing at the Diner # Silas fills the team in on sabotage plans targeting Elspeth’s car. Twilight Company wants them to sabotage rival cars in Bay 10 and Bay 12. After paying for a meal and some banter with a chameleon-accented waitress, the group heads to the garage. 2. Surprise in the Van # Upon checking the garage and Elspeth’s bay, the party hears noises in their van. They discover three gnomes inside assembling a bomb. Combat breaks out: two gnomes are killed (via Eldritch Blast and melee), one is stabilized and captured. 3. Interrogating Philbin # Philbin reveals they were hired anonymously at \u0026ldquo;Arby’s\u0026rdquo; to sabotage the party’s car. He claims ignorance of the benefactor\u0026rsquo;s identity, describing them only as hooded and threatening. 4. Resurrecting the Gnomes # Red escorts the injured gnomes to a Temple of Tyr. An old cleric revives them. The party coerces the gnomes to finish the bomb and repurpose it to sabotage Bay 10’s car. 5. Sabotage Missions # Bay 10: Silas plants the finished bomb under a racecar while Hellasana distracts guards with a dramatic act. Bay 12: Silas and Bru sneak in. Bru welds the exhaust closed using artificer tools and spells. Silas stalls a suspicious dwarf with flirtation and misdirection. 6. Aftermath and Arby’s Recon # The group reconvenes. Bru is stationed to guard Elspeth’s car. The rest investigate Arby’s for leads on the mysterious saboteur. Interrogation of the front desk and Dirk yields no concrete info. Plan to use Minor Illusion to bait a reaction from suspects is discussed but not executed. Memorable Moments # “Castle Doctrine” humorously invoked to justify murder in their own garage. Philbin’s whining becomes a running gag. Silas’ seduction attempt of a dwarf is absurdly effective. Bru’s sabotage using artificer ingenuity. Arby’s as a hub for underground dealings—ironic given its mundane facade. Ongoing Threads # Mystery of the benefactor behind the gnome saboteurs. Who is trying to sabotage Elspeth? Is it connected to the Twilight Company? The Briefcase: Mentioned to be with Olivia; possibly a future plot thread. Arby’s stakeout: The group may continue to investigate there. Closing # Episode ends with a successful dual sabotage and a vague lead at Arby’s. The crew is exhausted, suspicious, and mildly traumatized but victorious.

Inside, she finds a set of color-coded journals authored by her grandson George, who was last known to be working with the Twilight Company. George’s notes detail a mysterious operation called Project Purple Patch, feuds among High Forge’s underground gangs, and a religious mission involving Father Jacob and Mother Asuka. George was last seen heading north on a pilgrimage tied to the Church of Tyr. Olivia finds a lead in the journals pointing toward a halfling named Finnegan, an information broker who has interfaced with both Twilight Company and the gang Iron Claws. Reuniting the Crew # Silas, Red, and Olivia reconvene at a garage after a period of scattered rest. The party shares updates: Red reveals a Twilight Company hit order against “Healing Touch” — his parents — marked with a certified stamp. Silas confirms the order looks official, despite the Twilight Company not typically engaging in contract killings. The group decides to dig deeper into the Twilight Company’s network and determine how and why Red’s parents were targeted. A Trip to the Cathedral # The trio visits the Cathedral of Tyr, which doubles as a courthouse and jail. Red grapples with the revelation that his pacifist beliefs may have been sheltered from the harsher doctrines of Tyr’s justice. Olivia secures a sealed letter of authority from the bishop, sanctioning her to investigate George’s disappearance on the Church\u0026rsquo;s behalf. The Twilight Company Meeting # The group attends an open Twilight Company meeting held under a bar called the Little Hobble. Silas, under the alias Martin Birchwood, marks himself as a member using Thieves’ Cant to gain deeper access. Jobs listed at the meeting include car sabotage, political canvassing, artifact theft, and scouting missions — but no hit jobs, confirming the rarity of Red’s note. Olivia speaks with leaders including Cyrus, Rekha (tiefling), and Vector (dwarf), learning George last checked in from Lonnie’s Bar \u0026amp; Grill in Milstrom, en route to a shrine in the mountains. Key Intel # Project Purple Patch appears compromised; Finnegan is on a mission to investigate, meeting someone called Lady Viper. Twilight Company’s hierarchy includes an inner circle; Olivia and Red are identified by name and purpose by members, especially the observant Rekha. Silas eavesdrops on internal discussions, learning about Twilight’s role in manipulating High Forge politics and counterbalancing the Iron Claws. Rekha seems especially astute and potentially suspicious of the group. Next Steps # Travel to Milstrom to follow George’s trail from Lonnie’s. Consider pursuing sabotage missions to support Elspeth’s race effort. Uncover more about Finnegan, the Night Boys, and the true aim of Project Purple Patch. Party Status # Olivia: Acting on church orders, equipped with official writ. Silas: Embedded in Twilight ranks under an alias. Red: Struggling with identity, loss, and implications of divine justice. Next Session: Prepping for the trip to Milstrom, potential infiltration or deeper involvement in Twilight internal affairs.

Foreigners are generally restricted to the Market Ward unless they have paperwork or sponsorship. The Market Ward is full of inns, traders, bars, and entertainment venues—and hosts the city’s underground racing scene.\n🎸 Act I: The Rock Show \u0026amp; Social Hub # Location: A raucous rock venue in the Market Ward. Hellasana has picked up a late-night performance slot. The crowd is small but energetic, and she becomes a local sensation for the night, gathering an impromptu fan club. Bru assists with technical support, tearing down gear and lamenting poor-quality stage setup by the prior act. Silas negotiates a lucrative performance contract with the venue while holding a mysterious briefcase full of gold. 🏁 Act II: Elspeth’s Underground Racing Comeback # Elspeth, a former professional racer, is navigating her return to the underground scene after a controversial disqualification. At the bar, she meets her former associate Thelvult, now sponsored by a major team. She reveals to Thelvult that she believes she was framed for race cheating (overpowering her vehicle), and that her car had been tampered with. Thelvult encourages her to join the upcoming underground race, providing her with contact info for Miss Talks, the punk-rock headhunter managing race entries. Elspeth signs up under the name Team Cooper, aware this might draw attention. 🏎️ Race Structure and Team Roles # The underground race on Sunday is large-scale (rumored 100 participants) and chaotic. Teams typically include:\nRacer Mechanic Spotter Saboteur (to disrupt other teams) Law Influencer (to manipulate legal consequences mid-race) Elspeth contemplates assembling her allies for these roles but hasn’t made formal asks yet. 🧳 Act III: The Briefcase Heist # Silas, Red, and Elspeth leave the club with a briefcase full of gold. Red carries Silas and the case through the city like a bodyguard. They attempt to reach Olivia’s apartment in the residential area, but are stopped by city guards. Visitors need special papers. Silas decides to forge the necessary documents using his charlatan skills, which will take at least an hour. The group detours back to a rented garage, where Elspeth discovers someone has tampered with her race car. 🛠️ Act IV: Investigation and Sabotage # While inspecting her vehicle, Elspeth confirms sabotage—someone who understands car mechanics tried to subtly damage her rig. Olivia joins the garage group early the next morning and sets up coffee and food. A Warforged named Racecar arrives with a cryptic warning: “You should not race. You are being targeted.” Racecar gives a clear description of the saboteur: a short, green-skinned goblin wearing black (turtleneck, gloves, pants). The team now has a suspect. Olivia, suspicious, interrogates Racecar and confirms the sabotage warning is real, but Racecar cannot name the culprit. 🍷 Act V: Hellasana \u0026amp; Bru’s Drunken Adventure # Hellasana and Bru, basking in post-show fame, party hard at the bar. Hellasana handles adoring fans while Bru gets blackout drunk. Bru eventually falls into a pool on the way to the motel and wanders lost before finally finding his room around 7 a.m. Hellasana secures her room with a fraction more dignity. 🔍 Act VI: Olivia’s Side Story – George \u0026amp; Finnegan # Olivia spends her night alone investigating the disappearance of her grand-nephew George. She stops by a local bodega (owned by “Bo Dega”) and chats with a shopkeeper. She learns George was seen with a suspicious halfling named Finnegan—charming, young, blonde, and always around shady people. Back at her apartment, Olivia finds a surprise note on her conspiracy board: “If I go missing, find my lockbox under Olivia Cooper. – George”\nShe adds “Finnegan” to her growing board of suspects and notes to install a security system. ☀️ Act VII: Morning of the Guild Job # As dawn breaks, the garage group wakes to coffee and muffins thanks to Olivia. They prepare for their 6 a.m. meeting with the Steven Guild, who had hired them to protect a caravan. The team shares intel about the upcoming race, Racecar’s warning, and the need to find out who sabotaged Elspeth’s car. Silas warns Red about a local Twilight Company branch operating near the venue—possibly dangerous or relevant to the race. The group now juggles multiple threads: A risky underground race A mysterious goblin saboteur A missing family member A performance tonight And a morning caravan job for the Steven Guild 🎭 Party Dynamics \u0026amp; Emerging Themes # Elspeth: Driven, betrayed racer seeking justice. Silas: Schemer with connections and charm, navigating danger with subtlety. Red: Loyal and strong, but possibly in over his head. Bru: Technical genius and chaos goblin—unpredictable but valuable. Hellasana: Rising star torn between fame and duty. Olivia: Savvy and deeply invested in both family and justice.

Silas – Scheming halfling rogue and manager of the band. Bru – Goblin artificer and chaos gremlin with a flair for pyrotechnics. Red (formerly Blue) – Goliath cleric, pacifist healer, and protector. Olivia – Elderly paladin with a cop-like sense of justice. Elspeth – Artificer gunslinger with a mechanical companion, BoxBox. Opening Scene: Chaos at the Tavern # The party is split between eating dinner and running a shell game when a Goliath barges into the Cog and Steam tavern shouting about “Bartley P. Thatch.” Chaos breaks out:\nA beer stein brains the Goliath. A full-on brawl begins. Bru magically engineers fart-scented peanuts and lobs them into the crowd. Olivia tries to intimidate the crowd but is punched and takes 4 damage. Silas steals 10 silver during the commotion and stealths away. Elspeth tries to back Olivia up with intimidation and BoxBox tackles a brawler. Red nervously assesses the situation and casts Guidance on Olivia. Bru sets off a fireworks cannon that creates fire-show chaos, followed by him throwing chairs and shouting “Fire!” while Kevin runs around screaming. Eventually, the tavern clears out thanks to a fire suppression system and Olivia and Elspeth’s crowd control. They leave the tavern in disarray. Post-Brawl: Recruitment Offer # Outside, a figure named Dirk from the Stephen Guild offers the party a job:\nGuard a caravan along the Gold Road to Eldoran. 500 gold for the job. Meeting time: 6 AM at the Garages Café near the caravan bays. The group is noncommittal and skeptical about the rate. Evening Activities # The party splits up:\n🎸 Hellasana # Investigates The Little Hovel, a dive metal club. Signs up to perform a set at 1 AM after scoping out terrible opening acts. Gains the attention of Sandra Talks, a sharply dressed talent agent scouting for a show. 🎲 Silas \u0026amp; Bru # Run a card cheating scam on local gamblers. Bru acts as spotter (poorly); Silas uses psychic dice and sleight of hand to win big. They win enough gold to buy burgers and reflect on their sloppy success. 🕶️ Red \u0026amp; Elspeth # Tag along to the Little Hovel to watch over the group. Red awkwardly wallflowers but eventually joins the others near the stage. Elspeth probes for underground racing contacts but doesn’t find much. Concert of the Century # Hellasana headlines the final act at The Little Hovel with support from Bru and Red:\nBru engineers stage pyrotechnics synced to the set. Red uses Thaumaturgy to enhance the flames with purple coloration. Hellasana delivers a transcendent metal performance enhanced by Guidance and Enhance Ability from Red. Audience members’ eyes glow purple, magic fills the air, and a surreal, euphoric concert atmosphere takes over. Performance rolls exceed 24. The show is an unforgettable success. Massive Payday # Silas negotiates a last-minute, high-profile gig with Sandra Talks for 10,000 gold: 1,000 gold up front in a suitcase. 6,000 upon arrival at the show. 3,000 after the show. The group is now flush with resources, contemplating splitting the gold and debating tour logistics (stay in van or book lodging). Cliffhanger \u0026amp; Next Steps # The group has conflicting commitments: a 6 AM meeting with Dirk and a high-paying concert the next night. They are now recognized as elite talent and might have choices to make between fame and duty.
