[{"content":" Session Overview # After investigating the mysterious killer contracts and bounties on their heads, the party participates in a dangerous mountain race while receiving crucial intelligence about High Forge and making disturbing discoveries about the dragon orb\u0026rsquo;s true nature.\nPre-Race Preparations # The session opens with final preparations for the dangerous mountain race organized by The Warden. Unlike typical races, this competition requires drivers to climb a mountain, retrieve a \u0026ldquo;crest\u0026rdquo; from the summit, and return without being killed by the creatures inhabiting the area.\nTeam Strategy and Roles # Team Assignments:\nElspeth: Primary driver of the Doomfall race car Olivia: Co-pilot providing combat support and navigation assistance BoxBox: Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s steel defender riding in the car\u0026rsquo;s special compartment Silas and Helisanna: Support team in the Vroomfall van, scouting ahead for obstacles and conducting sabotage operations Bru: Artillery specialist providing explosive support Sabotage Operations # Building on their previous race experience, Silas successfully drugs competitors Thelvolt and another racer using the mysterious substance from their adventure with Marvin, hoping to impair Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s competition.\nEquipment Upgrades: Elspeth enhances her race car with wheel spikes for offensive capability and a spoiler for improved aerodynamics, while planning to use their crystal collection to power the vehicle.\nFinal Preparations # Olivia casts Aid on Elspeth, Helisanna, and herself, providing 5 extra hit points each for the dangerous mountain journey. The team establishes radio communication using call signs \u0026ldquo;Driving Miss Daisy\u0026rdquo; (Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s car) and \u0026ldquo;Ellie and the Short Stacks\u0026rdquo; (the support van).\nThe High Stakes Mountain Race # Stage One: Boulder Sabotage and Avalanche # The Challenge: As racers begin the mountain ascent, the Vroomfall team scouts ahead and identifies an ambush by the Shield Bros team positioned to ram other cars on a precarious mountain path.\nCoordinated Sabotage:\nBru (Intelligence check: 21) analyzes the terrain and identifies the perfect explosive placement to create maximum chaos Silas (Sleight of Hand: 28) precisely plants dynamite in the Shield Bros\u0026rsquo; truck engine The perfectly timed explosion destroys the ambush vehicle and triggers an avalanche that clears a safe path for Elspeth while blocking other racers behind dangerous debris Early Lead: Elspeth (Driving check: 28) expertly navigates through the cleared path, establishing a commanding early lead over the competition.\nStage Two: Stone Golem Encounter # The Threat: Two massive stone golems emerge from the mountainside as Elspeth approaches, threatening to crush any passing vehicles with thrown boulders.\nCombat Sequence:\nElspeth (multiple driving checks of 25+) expertly maneuvers around the initial golem attacks while maintaining speed Olivia throws pocket dynamite (6 damage) at one golem from the van\u0026rsquo;s position The golems counterattack with massive thrown rocks, dealing 22 combined damage to the race car and bringing it to nearly half health Elspeth uses her Telekinetic Shove ability to push one golem backward, preventing a devastating second attack Olivia takes over driving while Elspeth attempts emergency repairs using her technical skills Dynamic Escape: Despite significant vehicle damage, Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s expert driving keeps them ahead of both the competition and the pursuing golems as they continue toward the summit.\nStage Three: The Summit Challenge # Reaching the Crest: Elspeth arrives at the wind-swept summit far ahead of other competitors, but discovers that race rules specifically require the driver to personally retrieve the crest.\nThe Rules Dilemma: When Olivia volunteers to grab the crest (hoping to protect Elspeth for the crucial return journey), hostile wraiths suddenly appear, declaring \u0026ldquo;The rules have been broken! They must be mended!\u0026rdquo;\nWraith Combat:\nThe spectral entities launch surprise attacks on Olivia but miss their initial strikes Elspeth attempts to throw the crest to Olivia but fails due to harsh winds and her position (rolled a 1) Olivia becomes grappled by wraith attacks but uses Misty Step to escape back to the car Recognizing the supernatural enforcement, Elspeth personally retrieves the crest as required Once the rules are properly followed, the wraiths disappear, satisfied with the compliance Stage Four: The Descent Gauntlet # Continued Advantages: The Vroomfall team\u0026rsquo;s earlier explosion continues to benefit Elspeth, as she can drive through the clear path they created while other racers struggle with debris and unstable terrain.\nPursuing Threats:\nA more aggressive stone golem emerges, crawling along the ground in pursuit of the leading car Olivia throws dynamite (Athletics check: 19) with devastating accuracy, hitting the creature directly and forcing it to retreat into the mountainside Multiple Challenges: Elspeth faces a series of increasingly difficult obstacles during the descent:\nFirst check (25): Successfully extends her lead against the pursuing golem Second check (22): Navigates additional environmental hazards and unstable terrain Third check (25): Outpaces another mountain creature emerging from the rocks Final check (20): Makes it safely back to town with exactly the needed result Victory and Celebration # Dominant Performance: Elspeth wins the race by such a wide margin that other competitors are still dealing with the stone golems on the mountain when she crosses the finish line.\nVictory Rewards:\nThe Warden\u0026rsquo;s Signet: A magical ring providing advantages for any vehicle operation (not limited to race cars) Racing Circuit Membership: Official recognition in the underground racing community Community Recognition: Establishment as elite racers capable of handling extreme challenges Victory Tradition: Following racing customs, Elspeth celebrates by performing a dramatic burnout and pouring \u0026ldquo;Brown\u0026rdquo; (Bru\u0026rsquo;s favorite chunky alcoholic stew) all over Bru, much to everyone\u0026rsquo;s amusement.\nThe Radio Transmission # While celebrating their racing victory in the Vroomfall, Bru intercepts an unexpected radio transmission on Red\u0026rsquo;s old communication device.\nThe Conversation # Bru overhears a conversation between Victor (their former Twilight Company associate) and an unknown female voice:\nKey Intelligence Revealed:\nVictor needs sulfur for explosive-making operations He\u0026rsquo;s working with a female associate on organized resistance activities The Iron Claws gang has taken complete control of High Forge after the dragon attack Helja is now effectively running the city under the dragons\u0026rsquo; authority Victor is operating from his laboratory in High Forge and refuses to abandon the city despite the danger Bru\u0026rsquo;s Intervention # Bru accidentally interrupts the transmission by asking \u0026ldquo;Are you making a bomb?\u0026rdquo; This leads to a tense moment before Victor recognizes Bru\u0026rsquo;s voice and demands verification of his identity.\nIdentity Confirmation: Victor tests Bru\u0026rsquo;s knowledge by asking about technical details of the piranha gun design, which Bru passes, leading to a more open conversation about their respective situations.\nVictor\u0026rsquo;s Operations # Resistance Activities: Victor explains he\u0026rsquo;s manufacturing explosives to target Iron Claws operations, specifically planning to attack a church and nightclub where the gang has established control.\nRecruitment Offer: Victor proposes helping the party with their advanced schematics in exchange for assistance with his resistance operations, mentioning they could use the old tunnel system to infiltrate the city covertly.\nCurrent Situation: Victor confirms that Helja has essentially become the shadow ruler of High Forge, operating under the dragons who control the upper levels of the city.\nDragon Orb Investigation # Following the radio transmission, the party conducts a thorough examination of the mysterious orb Silas stole from Helja, leading to crucial discoveries about its true nature and cosmic-level implications.\nSilas\u0026rsquo;s Dangerous Communication # Making Contact: Silas bravely volunteers to communicate with the entity within the orb, touching it despite the obvious dangers involved.\nThe Entity: The dragon identifies himself as \u0026ldquo;Everything\u0026rdquo; and immediately demonstrates his overwhelming presence and power during their psychic conversation.\nKey Revelations from the Exchange:\nThe dragon needs someone to open a dimensional rift to bring him to their world He\u0026rsquo;s willing to \u0026ldquo;eat\u0026rdquo; Helja if Silas cooperates with his plans He claims to be \u0026ldquo;closer than you think\u0026rdquo; to breaking through on his own He offers alliance but also threatens to \u0026ldquo;bury them in the ground\u0026rdquo; if they refuse cooperation He specifically asks what Helja means to Silas, suggesting complex relationships between all parties Silas\u0026rsquo;s Diplomatic Strategy: Rather than commit to anything concrete, Silas diplomatically deflects by saying he needs to \u0026ldquo;sleep on\u0026rdquo; any business decisions, successfully gathering intelligence while avoiding immediate commitments or confrontation.\nBru\u0026rsquo;s Arcana Mastery # Critical Analysis: Bru performs an exceptional analysis of the orb\u0026rsquo;s magical properties, rolling a natural 20 on his Arcana check and revealing crucial technical information.\nOrb Mechanics Discovered:\nFunctions as an extremely high-level magical communication device requiring 8th-9th level spells to create Creates a psychic connection that poses real danger of trapping weaker minds permanently The glass material is nearly unbreakable through any normal physical means Placing it in a Bag of Holding would create a catastrophic reality rift and likely summon the dragon immediately Dragon Intelligence Gathered:\nThe entity appears to be an Astral Dragon from a spectral plane of dragons These creatures specialize in conquering entire solar systems and galaxies systematically The dragon is likely targeting their entire solar system for conquest, not just their world This represents a cosmic-level threat far beyond local or even planetary concerns Security and Safety Concerns:\nThe orb can be scryed upon by anyone who knows of its existence and has appropriate magic Helja could potentially spy on them through the orb if she possesses the right divination spells Physical covering prevents visual scrying but does not block audio detection Silas\u0026rsquo;s psychic phone ability could be used to anchor multiple people during communication, preventing them from being lost in the dragon\u0026rsquo;s realm Strategic Planning Session # The party develops a comprehensive strategy for dealing with their multiple high-level enemies and the cosmic dragon threat.\nLeverage Analysis # Key Strategic Insights:\nThey possess the only known communication method with the dragon in the region The dragon appears willing to betray Helja, even offering to kill her for the right cooperation Maintaining the appearance of being potential allies gives them significant negotiating power The dragon cannot reach their world without someone actively opening a dimensional rift They represent the \u0026ldquo;third faction\u0026rdquo; in a three-way power struggle, giving them disproportionate influence Information Warfare Strategy # Diplomatic Approach with the Dragon:\nAvoid directly antagonizing the cosmic entity while gathering valuable intelligence Use the dragon\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of Helja to learn her weaknesses and operational methods Maintain the illusion they might cooperate while secretly planning countermeasures Never communicate with the dragon without proper psychic anchoring for safety String the dragon along to prevent him from more closely aligning with Helja Counter-Intelligence Measures:\nKeep the orb covered when not in active use to prevent casual scrying Establish protocols for safe communication that protect party members from mental domination Develop contingency plans for various scenarios involving the orb\u0026rsquo;s use or destruction Jasper\u0026rsquo;s Departure # In an emotionally significant scene, Jasper Gaines makes the difficult decision to leave the party and return home to Eldoran.\nThe Farewell Conversation # Jasper\u0026rsquo;s Reasoning:\nThe recent violence and warfare have triggered traumatic memories from his military service He feels his strength causes more destruction than good, despite his heroic intentions He wants to return to his family business and the children who depend on him The events at the mountaintop with Red\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice brought back painful associations with war Olivia\u0026rsquo;s Counsel: Olivia demonstrates her caring nature by encouraging Jasper to find someone to talk to about his mental health and trauma, showing understanding of his psychological struggles.\nParting Gifts: Jasper leaves behind:\nHis Eldoran armor with crystal embellishments for the party to use VIP tickets to his establishment, Gaines Brewery, Bakery, and Bankery A heartfelt note promising assistance if they ever visit Eldoran Character Concerns # Desertion Implications: The party worries about whether Jasper will face consequences for abandoning his military post and fighting against an Eldoran knight, though they note the only witness to his desertion (Eric) is dead.\nEmotional Impact: Jasper\u0026rsquo;s departure represents another loss for the group, though this one is by choice rather than death, adding complexity to their feelings about his decision.\nNew Allies and Equipment # Crimson the Cardinal # Bru uses his magical abilities to create a new familiar as a memorial to Red - a mechanical cardinal named Crimson equipped with a jetpack instead of natural flight. This flightless bird with artificial propulsion serves as both a practical tool and an emotional tribute to their lost friend.\nEquipment and Resources Assessment # Current Assets:\nRacing Victory Rewards: The Warden\u0026rsquo;s Signet (providing advantages for any vehicle operation) Advanced Technology: Eldoran armor and crystal-embedded weapons from Eric Magical Items: Various crystals from their adventures and the dangerous dragon orb Transportation: The Vroomfall van and Doomfall race car, both enhanced with recent modifications Ongoing Projects: The party continues working on their advanced schematics during downtime, including the rocket ship and pocket village construction using materials and knowledge gathered from various sources.\nJourney Toward High Forge # The session concludes with the party beginning their journey back toward High Forge, experiencing their first peaceful moment in weeks.\nThe Road Atmosphere # Environmental Observations:\nRolling countryside providing a stark contrast to recent mountain dangers Occasional dragon shadows passing overhead, reminding them of ongoing threats Bright glowing figures of Eldoran knights patrolling the roads between cities A strange calm after their recent intense adventures, though tension remains about their destination Character Reflection: The peaceful travel provides time for emotional processing, with Silas particularly noting both the comfort of his remaining companions and the persistent sadness of Red\u0026rsquo;s empty seat in the van.\nForeshadowing: Despite the momentary peace, everyone understands they\u0026rsquo;re heading into extremely dangerous territory where multiple powerful enemies await their arrival.\nOngoing Plot Threads # High Forge Resistance: Victor\u0026rsquo;s underground operations against Iron Claws control and potential alliance opportunities Dragon Threat: Managing the cosmic-level danger of \u0026ldquo;Everything\u0026rdquo; while maintaining leverage through information and communication control Helja\u0026rsquo;s Power: The criminal mastermind now effectively rules High Forge and actively hunts the party Tunnel Infiltration: Developing plans to use underground routes to avoid Iron Claws detection systems Advanced Schematics: Continued work on rocket ship and pocket village construction projects Jasper\u0026rsquo;s Future: Potential complications from his return to Eldoran as a deserter, and the VIP tickets providing future adventure opportunities Session Themes # This episode effectively balances high-octane action with character development and plot advancement, providing crucial intelligence about enemy situations while exploring the emotional costs of their ongoing adventures. The racing sequence demonstrates the party\u0026rsquo;s growing tactical sophistication and teamwork, while the dragon orb investigation reveals the truly cosmic scale of threats they\u0026rsquo;re confronting.\nJasper\u0026rsquo;s departure adds emotional weight to the ongoing dangers they face, showing how trauma and moral complexity affect even the strongest characters. The session\u0026rsquo;s conclusion, with the peaceful journey toward High Forge, provides necessary breathing space before what promises to be their most dangerous arc yet, while the various revelations about Victor, Helja, and the dragon set up multiple interconnected challenges for future sessions.\nThe episode showcases the campaign\u0026rsquo;s evolution from local adventures to cosmic-scale threats, while maintaining focus on character relationships and personal growth amid increasingly dangerous circumstances.\n","date":"20 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-24/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party receives a mysterious radio transmission and uncovers dangerous truths about the dragon orb while preparing for their return to High Forge.","title":"24: Voices from High Forge","type":"sessions"},{"content":"","date":"20 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Moonfall Sessions","summary":"","title":"Moonfall Sessions","type":"page"},{"content":"Look back at session summaries from the entire campaign.\n","date":"20 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/","section":"Sessions","summary":"","title":"Sessions","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # The party returns to Milstrom to process Red\u0026rsquo;s loss and discovers disturbing information about bounties on their heads, Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s supernatural influence over her fans, and a dangerous underground racing event that could be their next challenge.\nExamining the Rocket Schematics # The session opens with the party studying the rocket ship blueprints they acquired from the Skyhammer clan. Silas raises concerns about whether the technology requires human sacrifice to power it, similar to what happened to Red. Bru and Elspeth examine the schematics to determine if they can modify the power source.\nThe party discusses using their abundant crystal collection as an alternative power source, including:\nCrystals from Eric\u0026rsquo;s Eldoran armor Interdimensional crystals from Marcus Various other magical crystals they\u0026rsquo;ve accumulated Memorial for Red # The party decides to hold a memorial service for Red at his childhood home in Milstrom. However, upon arrival, they discover the house occupied by adults playing what appears to be strip Twister. After some awkward investigation (including insight checks to determine the exact nature of the game), the party evicts the squatters and sets up the memorial outside instead.\nThe Memorial Service # Olivia creates a makeshift headstone and lights a small fire Silas retrieves symbols of Tyr from the underground tunnels Bru crafts a commemorative figurine of Red using his artificer skills Jasper offers simple but heartfelt words: \u0026ldquo;Wish we could have known you a bit longer there, pal. Hope you rest easy here in the earth and live free among the stars.\u0026rdquo; Bru remains silent but emotional, still clearly angry about Red\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice Silas receives a magical tattoo from Bru - a Spell Wrought Tattoo that allows him to recover one expended spell slot (3rd level or lower) once per day.\nRoscoe\u0026rsquo;s Return # After the memorial, the party encounters Roscoe, the eccentric warforged, who joins them for drinks at the Milstrom Inn while singing Piano Man.\nThe Bounty Hunter Encounter # Meeting Roger # At the tavern, Bru overhears a suspicious conversation between a man and the barkeeper. The stranger, Roger, is asking about Bo Dega and offering a reward for information. When the party confronts him, Roger attempts to flee but is caught using Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s Levitate spell.\nIntelligence Gathering # Under interrogation (enhanced by Olivia\u0026rsquo;s Zone of Truth), Roger reveals crucial information:\nThe Iron Claws Takeover:\nAfter the dragon attack on High Forge two weeks ago, the Iron Claws gang moved in and took control They now control the gates and monitor tunnel traffic The gang has established bounties on numerous people Active Bounties:\nSilas has the largest bounty on his head Bo Dega also has a significant price Several other associates including \u0026ldquo;Victor\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Lenny\u0026rdquo; The Ravers Phenomenon:\nGroups of people with purple eyes have been gathering in High Forge They\u0026rsquo;re described as \u0026ldquo;zombie-like\u0026rdquo; teenagers and young adults They spend time in the \u0026ldquo;under lake\u0026rdquo; area and are obsessed with music Their behavior began after Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s concerts The Drug Connection # The party realizes the purple-eyed \u0026ldquo;Ravers\u0026rdquo; may be connected to:\nThe drug-contaminated water they created when dumping Bo Dega\u0026rsquo;s substances in the lake Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s supernatural musical influence A combination of both factors Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s Supernatural Influence # Testing the Effect # Helisanna performs for the locals and demonstrates her supernatural influence:\nPurple mist emanates from her performance and spreads through the area Local residents, including Roger, develop purple eyes and join in the musical performance The effect appears to primarily affect teenagers and young adults The party members themselves are unaffected Investigation into Her Patron # Under questioning from Olivia, Helisanna reveals limited information about her warlock patron:\nShe made a pact in a dark place with purple flames or smoke The entity was described as androgynous with an otherworldly presence She received her magical abilities and instrument through this pact The supernatural effects on her audience appear to be automatic and uncontrolled The Underground Race # Race Announcement # Elspeth discovers her car radio has been activated remotely, announcing an underground race:\nMeeting time: Midnight at the Milstrom Inn Race start: 1 AM The announcement uses the same voice as Roger\u0026rsquo;s radio contact, suggesting coordination Race Rules and Dangers # The race organizer, The Warden, explains the simple but deadly rules:\nRacers must drive up a mountain Grab a \u0026ldquo;crest\u0026rdquo; at the summit Return without getting eaten Only rule: the driver must personally retrieve the crest High likelihood of death for participants Participants # The race includes several familiar faces from Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s racing background:\nAlesso Thelvolt Racecar Lazarus The Warden (organizer) Pre-Race Preparations # Sabotage Operations # Silas successfully drugs Thelvolt and another racer\u0026rsquo;s drinks using a substance from their previous adventure with Marvin, hoping to impair Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s competition.\nIntelligence Gathering on The Warden # Bru conducts surveillance on The Warden and makes several discoveries:\nThe Radio DJ Revelation:\nThe Warden operates a radio station from his RV He plays music including songs by \u0026ldquo;Doomfall\u0026rdquo; (the party\u0026rsquo;s band) His show includes commercial breaks and music programming He plays an eclectic mix including \u0026ldquo;Dixie Chicks\u0026rdquo; and Maroon 5 Stealing Contracts: Working with Silas as a distraction, Bru breaks into the RV and steals:\nAll killer contracts (organized alphabetically) Racing contracts (the thickest binder) The theft reveals organized criminal activity beyond just race organization Equipment Upgrades # Elspeth acquires new racing modifications:\nWheel spikes for offensive capability Spoiler for improved aerodynamics Plans to use their crystal collection to power the vehicle Character Development and Relationships # Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s Growing Concern # The revelation of her supernatural influence on teenagers creates moral concerns for Helisanna, though she maintains it\u0026rsquo;s unintentional. Her advice to a young fan to wait until 18 before doing drugs shows some responsibility, though the fan interprets this as permission.\nSilas\u0026rsquo;s Criminal Past # The session reinforces the ongoing threat from Silas\u0026rsquo;s theft of the dragon orb from the Iron Claws, with his bounty being the largest among the party members.\nTeam Coordination # The party demonstrates improved coordination during:\nThe interrogation of Roger using multiple skills and spells The heist operation at The Warden\u0026rsquo;s RV Preparation for the upcoming race Ongoing Plot Threads # Iron Claws Control: The criminal organization now controls High Forge and actively hunts the party Purple-Eyed Ravers: Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s supernatural influence creates concerning followers The Mountain Race: A dangerous competition with unknown creatures threatening participants Stolen Contracts: Evidence of organized criminal activity involving races and assassinations Bo Dega\u0026rsquo;s Safety: Their friend remains a target for bounty hunters Crystal Technology: Potential for modifying the rocket technology using their acquired crystals Session Themes # This episode effectively balances grief processing with escalating external threats. The memorial for Red provides emotional closure while new dangers emerge through the bounty hunter encounter and race preparation. Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s supernatural influence introduces moral complexity about unintended consequences of power, while the criminal contracts suggest the party has stumbled into a larger conspiracy involving underground racing and assassination networks.\nThe session sets up the dangerous mountain race as the next major challenge while establishing the Iron Claws as an ongoing antagonist organization with significant resources and reach.\n","date":"13 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-23/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party holds a memorial for Red while uncovering Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s supernatural influence and preparing for a dangerous mountain race.","title":"23: Purple-Eyed Ravers and Racing Contracts","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Opening: Arrival on the Mountain # The session begins with the party being transported by Marcus through a portal, emerging on a cold, snowy mountaintop outside a cave. A bitter blizzard whips around them, but their magical sheep wool cloaks (from their previous adventure) provide protection. Everyone except Jasper successfully makes their constitution saves against the harsh weather, leaving him with disadvantage on dexterity saves until Red gives him Magnolia\u0026rsquo;s warm blanket.\nThe Eldoran Attack # Sounds of Battle # Through the blizzard, the party hears horn blasts and commotion from a nearby Goliath village. Bru\u0026rsquo;s high perception allows him to spot people running from a point of light - a figure in glowing armor. With exceptional perception rolls, the party identifies the figure as Eric, the Eldoran Knight they had encountered previously, now wielding a sword and cutting down Goliath guards.\nRed\u0026rsquo;s enhanced sensors (as he\u0026rsquo;s still connected to the spaceship systems) reveal that Eldoran soldiers had planted explosives to trigger the avalanche, and more soldiers are approaching from two hours away.\nJasper\u0026rsquo;s Choice # As Eric approaches, she calls out to Jasper: \u0026ldquo;Jasper! Help me kill these infidels!\u0026rdquo; However, Jasper makes a crucial moral choice, shouting back \u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t let you kill them\u0026rdquo; and charging to attack Eric instead of joining her. This moment solidifies Jasper\u0026rsquo;s allegiance with the party against the Eldoran Empire.\nCombat Preparation # The party prepares for battle with Red casting Emboldening Bond on Jasper, Silas, and Olivia, while also providing Bless to give them additional d4 bonuses. Silas uses exceptional stealth (rolling 30) to position himself for sneak attacks.\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Ultimate Choice # The Spaceship Dilemma # With an avalanche approaching in three rounds and Eric attacking, Red faces a critical decision. He can either:\nStay in flight mode and launch the spaceship in three rounds Transform into terrestrial/robot mode to fight but delay the launch The Elder desperately calls for Red to enter the special chamber, explaining it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;his destiny\u0026rdquo; as a Skyhammer to power the ship.\nThe Transformation # Despite the party\u0026rsquo;s concerns and limited understanding of what will happen, Red chooses to enter the humanoid-shaped chamber. The process is described as invasive, with ports connecting directly to his spine and neural system. Red undergoes a horrifying transformation where his consciousness slowly merges with the spaceship, feeling \u0026ldquo;piece by piece transition from this fleshy body to something very large, semi-inorganic.\u0026rdquo;\nRed emerges as a massive robot form but quickly realizes he\u0026rsquo;s losing control to the ship\u0026rsquo;s systems, warning his friends: \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;m in control anymore. I feel as though the spaceship has taken over me and not me the ship.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Battle with Eric # Eric\u0026rsquo;s Enhanced State # Eric reveals she has taken the mysterious eye-drop drug (the \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo; substance), significantly enhancing her speed and combat abilities. She demonstrates devastating combat prowess with multiple attacks per turn and legendary actions.\nParty Coordination # The battle showcases excellent teamwork:\nHelisanna successfully uses the new Sleep spell, incapacitating Eric temporarily Silas provides consistent sneak attack damage from stealth positions Olivia delivers devastating critical hits with Divine Smite, dealing 47 damage in one attack Elspeth contributes solid ranged damage with her magical gun Bru uses Color Spray through Kevin to blind Eric, providing advantage for all attacks The Emboldening Bond Heroics # The party makes dramatic use of Red\u0026rsquo;s Emboldening Bond ability, with party members teleporting to intercept attacks meant for dying allies:\nOlivia teleports to save Jasper from a killing blow Silas later saves Olivia from a devastating area attack, using his Evasion ability to take no damage Eric\u0026rsquo;s Desperation # As the battle turns against her, Eric becomes increasingly desperate, using multiple legendary actions and powerful area attacks. Her final shockwave attack nearly kills multiple party members before Helisanna delivers the killing blow with an enhanced Eldritch Blast, described as a \u0026ldquo;Super Saiyan-esque\u0026rdquo; double-handed blast while under the influence of the eye-drop drug.\nThe Tragic Revelation # Red\u0026rsquo;s Permanent Transformation # After the battle, the party discovers the horrifying truth: Red cannot be safely removed from the spaceship. When they attempt to communicate with him, they receive mixed signals - sometimes it sounds like Red, sometimes like an artificial intelligence that merely uses his voice patterns.\nBru attempts to engineer a solution, rolling a natural 20 on Arcana to understand the situation. However, even with his exceptional skill, he realizes that removing Red would likely kill him or leave him in a state \u0026ldquo;worse than death.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Ship\u0026rsquo;s Explanation # The spaceship/Red entity reveals disturbing information:\nRed is permanently integrated with the ship While Red chose to enter the chamber, he was not fully informed of the consequences The transformation cannot be reversed without destroying Red\u0026rsquo;s organic form The original Red\u0026rsquo;s consciousness experienced \u0026ldquo;horrible pain\u0026rdquo; during the process Bru\u0026rsquo;s Violent Response # Overcome with grief and rage, Bru confronts the Elder who orchestrated Red\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice. Despite Red\u0026rsquo;s pleas for restraint, Bru stabs the Elder in the gut and whispers a threat: \u0026ldquo;You have made an enemy of all goblins. If you see another goblin, prepare to die.\u0026rdquo;\nDeparture and Aftermath # Leaving the Goliaths # The party makes the difficult decision to leave the spaceship and the Goliath clan behind. They refuse to join the space colonization mission, both because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to abandon their world and because they\u0026rsquo;re disgusted by how the Goliaths treated Red.\nJasper chooses to accompany the party, officially breaking with the Eldoran Empire and joining their group permanently.\nThe Sleigh Escape # Using their artifice skills, Bru and Elspeth construct an impressive sleigh powered by their magical sheep and Bob the ram. They ransack the Goliath compound, stealing advanced technology and Eric\u0026rsquo;s crystal-embedded armor and weapons.\nReturn to Milstrom # The party makes excellent time down the mountain and returns to Milstrom, Red\u0026rsquo;s adoptive hometown. They reunite with their vehicles (the Vroomfall and Doomfall) and take a much-needed long rest.\nCharacter Development and Gifts # Memorial Preparations # The party spends the evening drinking and reminiscing about Red, planning some form of memorial service. Bru creates magical tattoos as tributes:\nSilas receives a Spell Wrought Tattoo with a first-level spell, designed as a memorial to Red Bru plans to give himself a similar tattoo The tattoos serve as permanent reminders of their lost friend Equipment Upgrades # Bru presents Olivia with a Propulsion Shield - a magical shield that pushes attackers away when she\u0026rsquo;s hit, designed to help protect her during her tendency to charge into melee combat.\nJasper\u0026rsquo;s Integration # Jasper fully integrates with the party, sharing their grief over Red\u0026rsquo;s loss and demonstrating his commitment to their cause over the Empire\u0026rsquo;s. His decision to fight Eric instead of the party proves his loyalty and moral character.\nSession Themes and Impact # Sacrifice and Loss # This session explores the heavy theme of sacrifice, particularly when someone makes a decision without fully understanding the consequences. Red\u0026rsquo;s transformation raises questions about informed consent and the expectations placed on leaders or \u0026ldquo;chosen ones.\u0026rdquo;\nMoral Complexity # The Elder\u0026rsquo;s perspective that Red made a \u0026ldquo;heroic sacrifice\u0026rdquo; contrasts sharply with the party\u0026rsquo;s view that Red was manipulated and betrayed. The session doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide easy answers about whether the sacrifice was justified.\nFound Family # The party\u0026rsquo;s devastation over losing Red demonstrates how much they\u0026rsquo;ve grown as a found family. Their refusal to abandon him, even when it means opposing an entire clan, shows the strength of their bonds.\nPolitical Awakening # Jasper\u0026rsquo;s choice to side against the Empire represents a significant political moment, showing how individual relationships can overcome institutional loyalty.\nOngoing Plot Threads # Red\u0026rsquo;s Fate: While Red is effectively gone as a player character, his consciousness might still exist within the spaceship Anti-Goliath Sentiment: Bru has declared all Goliaths his enemies, potentially affecting future encounters Eldoran Technology: The party has acquired advanced crystal-powered equipment Jasper\u0026rsquo;s Integration: The former Eldoran soldier must find his place within the group The Space Colony: The Goliath spaceship represents an ongoing threat or potential ally Returning to High Forge: The party prepares to return to their original destination Session Conclusion # This session serves as a major turning point in the campaign, permanently altering the party composition and establishing Red\u0026rsquo;s sacrifice as a defining moment for the group. The combination of intense combat, emotional character development, and difficult moral choices creates one of the campaign\u0026rsquo;s most impactful episodes.\nThe party emerges from this experience more tightly bonded but also carrying the trauma of being unable to save their friend.

They visit a shattered world held together by desperate magic, where they meet the survivors of a time travel disaster and learn valuable lessons about the dangers of unchecked scientific ambition.\nArrival in the Astral Sea # The party finds themselves on floating islands connected by psionic chains and tree roots in what Bru identifies as the Astral Sea. The landscape consists of:\nMassive floating fragments held together by magical roots and chains A dying city-sized tree (Matthew Broadtwig) that serves as the anchor point Various structures including a massive clock tower with floating gears A pale white dwarf star providing dim illumination Meeting the Survivors # Scarlet - The Artist/Former Assassin # The party encounters Scarlet, a short blonde elf who maintains the world\u0026rsquo;s stability through magical painting. Key details about her:\nUses enchanted paints to create physical manifestations of what she draws Former assassin who used map alteration to trap and kill targets Currently responsible for connecting new floating islands to keep the world stable In a complicated relationship with Marcus spanning multiple timelines Gives the party a magical paint set that can alter reality through artwork Matthew Broadtwig - The Dying World Tree # Bru discovers a massive tree that speaks telepathically, revealing itself as Matthew Broadtwig:\nA sentient tree the size of a city whose roots hold the floating islands together Dying due to insufficient light from the pale star and general world decay Gives Bru a seed to plant in their world, claiming it will stabilize their reality Explains that when he dies, the world will completely fall apart Part of a complex relationship triangle with Scarlet and Marcus Exploring Marcus\u0026rsquo;s Tower # The Chronomancer\u0026rsquo;s Workshop # The party investigates Marcus\u0026rsquo;s tower, discovering:\nWorkshop Contents:\nTime gun schematics (stolen by Helisanna) showing how to use explosions to tear through space-time Detailed journals documenting thousands of time travel attempts Evidence of multiple timeline iterations where the three survivors tried different approaches Photographs showing Marcus and Scarlet had children in some timelines who died from the experiments Magical Technology:\nViolessence crystals similar to but more advanced than Eldoran technology Red\u0026rsquo;s exceptional perception (Natural 20) reveals these crystals are artificially created rather than naturally occurring A multidimensional radio that picks up communications from other realities Time bubbles floating throughout the tower showing scenes from different timelines and realities Confronting Marcus the Chronomancer # The Rock-Off Challenge # The party meets Marcus, a arrogant chronomancer wearing a beret and working on timeline calculations. When he dismisses them as \u0026ldquo;simple minds,\u0026rdquo; Helisanna challenges him to a musical duel:\nPerformance Results:\nHelisanna rolls 30 on performance, completely overwhelming Marcus Her purple magical tendrils force him to play backup to her lead Marcus concedes defeat and agrees to listen to their questions The Time Gun Catastrophe # Marcus reveals the tragic history of their world:\nThe Original Disaster:\nCreated a time gun that required shooting yourself to travel through time Could only travel to \u0026ldquo;nodes\u0026rdquo; - critical decision points in reality Each use consumed bullets; going backward used bullets, going forward restored them The device could only be controlled by shooting oneself with it The Endless Loop:\nMarcus, Scarlet, and Matthew have lived for two millennia trying to fix their mistake They\u0026rsquo;ve tried every possible combination: different relationships, having children, switching roles Every timeline eventually leads to the same disaster: someone creates the time gun They\u0026rsquo;re trapped in what Marcus calls \u0026ldquo;the Time Gun Timeline\u0026rdquo; where this outcome is inevitable Current Situation:\nMarcus has only one bullet left and has reached the last possible node in time He\u0026rsquo;s preparing to shoot himself one final time, knowing it will send him back millennia to start over The world continues to decay despite Scarlet and Matthew\u0026rsquo;s efforts to hold it together The Bathroom Heist # Despite repeated warnings not to enter the back room, Bru inevitably infiltrates what turns out to be a bathroom containing:\nA pedestal with dramatic lighting An iron flask of mysterious but obviously significant importance Bru successfully performs an Indiana Jones-style swap and steals the flask Uses the actual bathroom facilities, discovering an advanced bidet system Items Acquired and Revelations # Magical Items Obtained # Magical Paint Set (from Scarlet): Can alter reality by painting changes on maps or canvases World Tree Seed (from Matthew): Intended to stabilize their home reality when planted Multidimensional Radio (stolen by Red): Receives communications across realities Time Gun Schematics (stolen by Helisanna): Complete plans for time travel technology Iron Flask (stolen by Bru): Mysterious container of unknown but significant contents Advanced Violessence Crystals: More efficient power sources than known technology Critical Intelligence # Technological Warnings:\nConcentrating too much magical power in one location can shatter reality Time travel inevitably leads to paradoxes and world-ending disasters The artificial crystals represent technology more advanced than current Eldoran capabilities Cosmic Implications:\nThe Astral Sea contains fragments of multiple destroyed realities Their world\u0026rsquo;s violessence crystals may have similar destructive potential Eldora\u0026rsquo;s collection of violessence could lead to a similar catastrophe Return to Their World # Marcus\u0026rsquo;s Portal # After delivering his cautionary tale, Marcus opens a portal to send them home:\nTransports them to a snowy mountaintop outside a Goliath village Near the cave system where Red\u0026rsquo;s trials originally began The party is now equipped with powerful magical items and crucial knowledge The Lesson Learned # The visit serves as Sol\u0026rsquo;s intended warning about the dangers of:\nUnchecked magical experimentation Concentrating too much power in single locations Time travel and attempts to \u0026ldquo;fix\u0026rdquo; past mistakes The hubris of believing technology can solve fundamental problems Character Development and Themes # Bru\u0026rsquo;s Chaos Theory # Bru continues his pattern of doing exactly what he\u0026rsquo;s told not to do, successfully stealing the mysterious iron flask despite repeated warnings. His natural curiosity and disregard for authority consistently drives plot advancement.\nHelisanna\u0026rsquo;s Growing Power # Her musical abilities prove capable of overwhelming even experienced magical practitioners like Marcus, suggesting her bardic magic continues evolving beyond normal parameters.\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Technical Insight # Red\u0026rsquo;s exceptional understanding of crystal technology provides crucial intelligence about the relationship between their world\u0026rsquo;s violessence and the advanced power sources they\u0026rsquo;ve discovered.\nMoral Complexity # The session explores themes of unintended consequences, the dangers of perfectionism, and how attempts to fix mistakes can often make them worse. Marcus, Scarlet, and Matthew serve as tragic figures trapped by their own good intentions.\nOngoing Plot Implications # Future Threats # Eldora\u0026rsquo;s Crystal Collection: The cautionary tale suggests Eldora\u0026rsquo;s violessence gathering could lead to similar reality-shattering consequences Time Gun Technology: The party now possesses the knowledge to create time travel technology, presenting both opportunity and extreme danger Iron Flask Mystery: Bru\u0026rsquo;s stolen artifact likely contains something of cosmic significance World Tree Planting: Matthew\u0026rsquo;s seed represents either salvation or another potential disaster for their reality Enhanced Capabilities # The party\u0026rsquo;s new magical items provide significant advantages:\nReality-altering paint for creative problem-solving Advanced power sources for Bru\u0026rsquo;s inventions Multidimensional communication capabilities Potential for growing their own world-stabilizing tree Session Conclusion # This interlude successfully delivers Sol\u0026rsquo;s intended lesson while providing the party with powerful new tools and crucial knowledge about cosmic-level threats. The tragic fate of Marcus, Scarlet, and Matthew serves as both warning and inspiration, demonstrating what happens when heroes become trapped by their own attempts at perfection.\nThe session ends with the party returned to familiar territory but fundamentally changed by their experience, carrying both the burden of knowledge about potential futures and the tools that might help them avoid similar catastrophes in their own world.\n","date":"30 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-11/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party visits a shattered world as a cautionary tale about the dangers of uncontrolled magical experimentation and time travel.","title":"Interlude XI: The Wrecked World of the Quizzites","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # The party awakens to alarm bells in the astral tree village, discovering a fire on one of the branches. When they investigate, they encounter a mysterious figure that pulls them into a series of pocket dimensions where they must make increasingly difficult moral choices, culminating in a meeting with Velz’eth, a chaos god imprisoned by Crowley.\nThe Theater of Gifts # The Opening Performance # The party finds themselves on a semicircular stage before a packed audience, with a masked announcer in white controlling the proceedings. Each party member must draw from a deck of tarot cards, with their selections transforming into mystical items:\nThe Card Drawings:\nRed (card 11): Draws a card representing \u0026ldquo;blend, balance, find\u0026rdquo; and receives a vial of clear liquid that tastes like tears Jasper (card 1, The Hierophant): Gets a gold coin with the announcer\u0026rsquo;s mask etched into it Silas (The Hermit): Receives a lantern that \u0026ldquo;sees truth\u0026rdquo; after delivering a theatrical bow Elspeth (The Sun): Obtains a feather described as lifting burdens Bru (The Violet Crown): Is struck by a crystal arrow and nearly dies, beginning a pattern of near-death experiences Bru\u0026rsquo;s Critical Condition # Bru suffers severe injuries from the crystal arrow, beginning a recurring theme throughout the session where he hovers near death. Despite multiple healing attempts from Red and Elspeth, his wounds resist magical healing, forcing Jasper to carry him in a makeshift baby carrier.\nThe Canyon Sacrifice # The Impossible Choice # The party is transported to a desert plateau where they witness a monthly town sacrifice ritual. Two people hang upside down over a canyon:\nEtta: The town\u0026rsquo;s doctor and healer who has delivered every child for a decade Garen: The engineer who maintains the town\u0026rsquo;s water systems and infrastructure The Dilemma: The town requires one monthly sacrifice to maintain their prosperity. Both candidates are essential to the community\u0026rsquo;s survival, and the party must choose who dies.\nThe Decision and Consequences # After extensive debate, the party chooses to sacrifice Garen while giving him Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s feather, hoping it will save him from the fall. The strategy fails, and Garen dies. However, their decision sets in motion a chain of events:\nLong-term Impact: Without Garen\u0026rsquo;s engineering expertise, the town\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure fails during storms. Though Etta keeps people healthy during the exodus, the community eventually abandons the sacrifice system entirely and relocates, ending the cycle of monthly deaths.\nThe Carnival of Chaos # The Spinning Wheel Games # The party encounters a circus barker running games with a massive spinning wheel containing various symbols. Each party member experiences different magical effects:\nGame Results:\nJasper: Spins a pepper symbol, experiences intense sneezing that causes him to explode into confetti, and reappear teleported behind Silas Elspeth: Lands on a heart with arrow, becoming temporarily infatuated with Red (successfully resists acting on it) Red: Gets a magnetic symbol, causing metal objects to stick to his body Silas: Disappears to a psychiatrist\u0026rsquo;s office where he receives therapy about abandonment issues and returns with a prescription for \u0026ldquo;two laughs a day with water\u0026rdquo; Kevin: Witnesses a disturbing performance where one entertainer decapitates another and transplants the head onto a different body Escalating Chaos # As the games progress, the carnival takes a darker turn. The music becomes distorted, the wheel catches fire, and the tent begins burning as the party is transported away, suggesting the realm\u0026rsquo;s inherent instability.\nThe Mirror Choice # The Prisoner\u0026rsquo;s Dilemma # The party finds themselves in a sterile chamber facing mirror versions of themselves through a window. They must choose between two buttons: Trust or Betray, while their alternate selves face the same choice.\nThe Test: This represents a classic prisoner\u0026rsquo;s dilemma scenario where cooperation benefits both groups, but betrayal could provide individual advantage at the cost of mutual destruction.\nResolution: Both the party and their mirror selves choose to trust, resulting in a peaceful resolution where the walls fall away to reveal a beautiful meadow. The alternate versions shake hands with the party before dissolving into dust.\nVelz’eth\u0026rsquo;s Revelation # The Chaos God\u0026rsquo;s Prison # In the final realm, the party encounters Velz’eth, a chaos god who has been imprisoned in this pocket dimension. He reveals crucial information about the cosmic conflict:\nVelz’eth\u0026rsquo;s History:\nOnce maintained balance through chaos and motion rather than rigid order Was challenged to a game by \u0026ldquo;Fergus the Serpent Tongue\u0026rdquo; (revealed to be one of Crowley\u0026rsquo;s many names) Lost due to Crowley\u0026rsquo;s cheating and had his power stolen Has been trapped in this fractured reality while Crowley uses his stolen abilities The Moon Queen Connection # Velz’eth explains that Crowley/Fergus is working with the \u0026ldquo;Moon Queen\u0026rdquo; (Eldora) to create a world of \u0026ldquo;cold steel and blind salvation.\u0026rdquo; This alliance has allowed both entities to gain power through the systematic elimination of chaos and competing divine influences.\nThe Gift of Revenge # Velz’eth enchants the party\u0026rsquo;s items with \u0026ldquo;seeds of rupture\u0026rdquo; - fragments of his chaos power designed to help them eventually confront Crowley. He promises that when these seeds \u0026ldquo;bloom,\u0026rdquo; he will follow as possibility rather than divinity.\nReturn and Resolution # Healing and Revelation # Upon returning to the astral tree, the party discovers:\nThe fire has been extinguished, leaving only ash and small embers Bru is completely healed with no trace of his wounds Their items now bear the mark \u0026ldquo;Property of V\u0026rdquo; (Velz’eth) Enhanced Abilities # The enchanted items gain powerful one-time abilities specifically effective against Crowley and Eldora:\nToken: Automatically succeeds on insight or religion checks to determine intent Lantern: Reveals hidden or invisible creatures Vial: Removes any status condition from user or ally Half-heart Pendant: Allows swapping hit points with a willing creature Character Development and Themes # Moral Complexity # The session explores the party\u0026rsquo;s moral decision-making under pressure, forcing them to make choices with no clearly \u0026ldquo;right\u0026rdquo; answers. Their willingness to attempt creative solutions (like the feather gambit) shows their desire to subvert impossible scenarios.\nCosmic Stakes # The revelation of Crowley\u0026rsquo;s alternate identity and possible alliance with Eldora elevates the campaign\u0026rsquo;s stakes from local threats to cosmic-level conflicts between order and chaos.\nTeam Dynamics # Despite the stressful scenarios, the party demonstrates strong cohesion, particularly in their care for the critically injured Bru and their unanimous decision-making in crisis situations.\nOngoing Plot Threads # Crowley\u0026rsquo;s True Nature: The revelation that Crowley is \u0026ldquo;Fergus the Serpent Tongue\u0026rdquo; who stole divine power from a chaos god Eldora\u0026rsquo;s Alliance: The Moon Queen\u0026rsquo;s partnership with Crowley suggests coordinated divine manipulation Velz’eth\u0026rsquo;s Revenge: The chaos god\u0026rsquo;s plan to use the party as agents against his imprisoner Enhanced Arsenal: The party now possesses divinely enhanced tools specifically designed to counter Crowley\u0026rsquo;s abilities Balance vs. Order: The philosophical conflict between Velz’eth\u0026rsquo;s dynamic chaos and Eldora\u0026rsquo;s static order Session Impact # This interlude successfully raises the stakes of the campaign while providing the party with both crucial intelligence about their enemies and powerful tools for future confrontations. The moral choice scenarios serve as character development exercises, while the cosmic revelations about Crowley and Eldora reframe the entire campaign conflict.\nThe session demonstrates how even beneficial alliances (with Velz’eth) come with moral ambiguity, as the party must decide whether embracing chaos to fight tyrannical order aligns with their values. The \u0026ldquo;seeds of rupture\u0026rdquo; represent both opportunity and responsibility, setting up future dramatic confrontations with adequately prepared protagonists.\n","date":"16 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-10/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party is pulled into pocket dimensions where they face impossible moral choices and meet a imprisoned chaos god seeking revenge.","title":"Interlude X: The Chaos God's Gift","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # The party continues their surreal dream sequence as food ingredients in Crowley\u0026rsquo;s twisted cooking show competition. After surviving previous arena battles, they face their final challenge: infiltrating a dessert castle and completing individual tasks assigned by the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Food Duke. What begins as a structured challenge quickly devolves into magical chaos when the party\u0026rsquo;s chaotic tendencies override the carefully planned scenario.\nRound Three: The Dessert Castle # Arrival at the Castle # The party finds themselves outside an elaborate gingerbread castle with several defensive features:\nJawbreaker walls at the base level providing high armor class against attacks Pretzel gates reinforced with magical almond bark A molasses moat that would trap anyone who falls in Guard towers with red velvet cake guards patrolling Jasper\u0026rsquo;s Impulsive Assault: True to his barbarian nature, Jasper immediately attempts to bite through the castle wall. His attack on the jawbreaker exterior results in catastrophic failure - he takes 10 damage and loses the ability to speak for 30 minutes due to his broken jaw.\nCreative Infiltration # With the direct approach proving disastrous, the party opts for stealth:\nSilas\u0026rsquo;s Reconnaissance: Rolling an exceptional perception check (26), Silas spots accessible windows about 30 feet up that could provide alternative entry.\nHelisanna\u0026rsquo;s Ascent: Helisanna uses Misty Step to reach the upper level, discovering an archer\u0026rsquo;s walkway that circles the castle\u0026rsquo;s exterior. She successfully retrieves rope from a storage closet despite approaching guards.\nMaster of Disguise: Helisanna uses Minor Illusion twice to create convincing crates, hiding from guards with stealth rolls of 22 and 24. Her illusions are so perfect that guards actually stop to admire the \u0026ldquo;craftsmanship\u0026rdquo; of her fake crates.\nGroup Ascent: The party successfully climbs the rope to join Helisanna, with Jasper making an impressive athletics roll (22) despite his injured jaw.\nMeeting the Devil\u0026rsquo;s Food Duke # The Duke\u0026rsquo;s Challenges # The Devil\u0026rsquo;s Food Duke appears as multiple illusions and assigns each party member a specific task designed to either play to their strengths or exploit their weaknesses:\nIndividual Assignments:\nBru: Return books to their proper places in the wizard\u0026rsquo;s library using the \u0026ldquo;Chewy Decimal System\u0026rdquo; Helisanna: Perform waltz music (three-quarter time) in the ballroom for dancing guests Silas: Steal a single mint leaf from the center of the royal gardens undetected Jasper: Move jawbreakers down a hallway while maintaining his patience despite crowds The Duke claims to have foreseen all their actions, even producing a sketch of Jasper giving him the finger before Jasper actually does it.\nTask Executions and Chaos # Silas\u0026rsquo;s Stealth Mission # Silas demonstrates his mastery of stealth and infiltration:\nPerfect Reconnaissance: Rolling a natural 20 perception (26 total), he spots all guard movements Flawless Execution: Multiple stealth rolls of 21+ allow him to navigate the gardens undetected Quick Completion: He successfully retrieves the mint leaf and heads to investigate the growing magical disturbance Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s Musical Mastery # Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s ballroom performance becomes a triumph of creative adaptation:\nInstrumental Challenges: The ballroom contains no guitar, forcing her to adapt to unfamiliar instruments including a horn, kick drum, and cymbal.\nMusical Evolution:\nPerformance roll of 27: Her initial trumpet performance captivates the waltz dancers Magical Enhancement: Enchanted dancers bring her a candy guitar that projects sound without amplification Performance roll of 28: Her final metal performance with full band setup entrances the entire audience Unexpected Power: Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s performance proves so magically potent that the dancers\u0026rsquo; eyes glow purple, and she gains control over them, overriding even the Duke\u0026rsquo;s magical influence.\nThe Library Catastrophe # Bru and Jasper turn a simple book-sorting task into magical disaster:\nThe \u0026ldquo;Respining\u0026rdquo; Incident: Instead of properly organizing books by the Chewy Decimal System, Bru has Jasper cut the spines off books with his greatsword, then surgically reattaches them to wrong books using glue.\nMagical Backlash: The library\u0026rsquo;s organization system, maintained by arcane magic, reacts violently to the improper modifications:\nBooks begin falling from shelves and swirling through the air Magical sparks and dust clouds fill the chamber The building itself starts shaking and cracking A mana storm develops, creating chaos throughout the structure Unintended Success: While completely ignoring their assigned task, Bru and Jasper accidentally achieve their actual goal of destroying the castle.\nThe Final Confrontation # Convergence of Chaos # As the library destruction spreads throughout the castle, the party reconvenes:\nSilas arrives to find his companions casually walking away from magical destruction Book sampling: They discover the flying books are actually various cake flavors (Black Forest, tiramisu) Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s concert continues with her now commanding 18 entranced dancers plus stage musicians Loss of Control # The Devil\u0026rsquo;s Food Duke arrives to find his carefully planned scenario completely derailed:\nHelisanna\u0026rsquo;s magical influence has corrupted even the judges (The Blob and Miss Universe) His illusion powers prove ineffective against her musical enchantment Crowley begins to realize he\u0026rsquo;s losing control of the entire dream scenario Silas\u0026rsquo;s Fire Solution # Silas ends the confrontation decisively by using his fire breath ability (from being an Ashen Hell Pepper) to dispel all the Duke\u0026rsquo;s illusions at once, revealing the real Duke standing alone and slightly singed.\nThe Duke\u0026rsquo;s Surrender: Recognizing defeat, the Duke admits \u0026ldquo;I really don\u0026rsquo;t want to do this\u0026rdquo; and surrenders rather than fight a battle he cannot win.\nCrowley\u0026rsquo;s Disappointment: Crowley calls the Duke a coward for giving up, but the challenge is officially complete.\nDream Conclusion and Rewards # Waking Up # The party successfully completes the dream sequence and awakens feeling refreshed and accomplished. In contrast, the party members who weren\u0026rsquo;t part of this dream (Red, Elspeth, Olivia, and Kevin) wake up sick with food-related nightmares.\nDream Rewards # Zack awards the successful participants a magical picnic basket containing special food items that provide beneficial effects:\nCheese (from Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s transformation) Jerky (from Jasper\u0026rsquo;s transformation) Garlic (from Bru\u0026rsquo;s transformation) Chili (from Silas\u0026rsquo;s transformation) Each item provides magical benefits for 24 hours when consumed.\nCharacter Development and Themes # Subverting Expectations # This session showcases how the party\u0026rsquo;s chaotic tendencies can turn even carefully planned scenarios into unpredictable adventures. Bru and Jasper\u0026rsquo;s complete disregard for instructions creates more interesting results than following the prescribed challenges.\nIndividual Strengths # Helisanna demonstrates her true power as both musician and magical performer, showing that her abilities extend far beyond simple entertainment into genuine enchantment and crowd control.\nSilas proves his competence at stealth and problem-solving, easily completing his assigned task while remaining adaptable to changing circumstances.\nCreative Problem-Solving # The session rewards creative thinking and character consistency over conventional approaches:\nHelisanna\u0026rsquo;s illusion crates becoming legendary in their perfection Bru\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;respining\u0026rdquo; technique causing magical chaos Silas\u0026rsquo;s straightforward competence cutting through complexity Dream Logic and Meta-Commentary # The food-themed dream allows for absurd situations while maintaining internal consistency. The session also includes meta-commentary about D\u0026amp;D tropes, cooking shows, and video game references (particularly Portal\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;the cake is a lie\u0026rdquo;).\nSession Impact # Crowley\u0026rsquo;s Ongoing Influence # This dream sequence demonstrates Crowley\u0026rsquo;s continued psychological warfare against the party, though it also shows his schemes can backfire when faced with the party\u0026rsquo;s unpredictable nature.\nParty Dynamics # The session reinforces each character\u0026rsquo;s core traits:\nJasper\u0026rsquo;s impulsiveness and love of combat (and eating) Bru\u0026rsquo;s chaotic creativity and problem-solving through destruction Silas\u0026rsquo;s competence and pragmatism Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s growing magical power and performance abilities Future Implications # Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s display of crowd control magic and the party\u0026rsquo;s ability to completely derail supernatural scenarios suggests they\u0026rsquo;re becoming more formidable opponents for cosmic-level threats like Crowley.\nNotable Quotes and Moments # The Duke\u0026rsquo;s Prophecy Failure: Despite claiming to foresee everything, the Duke admits that once the party arrived, \u0026ldquo;none of it can be planned.\u0026rdquo;\nBru\u0026rsquo;s Innovation: The invention of \u0026ldquo;respining\u0026rdquo; books as a method of magical sabotage.\nHelisanna\u0026rsquo;s Confidence: Her casual acceptance of stage musicians and magical instruments as \u0026ldquo;just another night for Helisanna.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Chewy Decimal System: Zack\u0026rsquo;s missed opportunity to call it the \u0026ldquo;Chewy Decimal System\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;Desi-Duimal System,\u0026rdquo; leading to player commentary about perfect pun timing.\nThis interlude successfully balances absurd comedy with character development while advancing the ongoing conflict with Crowley through unconventional means. The session demonstrates that sometimes the best way to handle elaborate villain schemes is to completely ignore them in favor of creative chaos.\n","date":"9 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-9/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party concludes their twisted cooking show dream with a dessert castle infiltration that quickly spirals into magical chaos and destruction.","title":"Interlude IX: Recipe for Disaster","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # The party experiences a surreal dream sequence where they\u0026rsquo;re transformed into cooking ingredients and forced to participate in a deadly cooking show competition hosted by Crowley and judged by mysterious entities.

They awaken bound and gagged in what appears to be a kitchen, having been shrunk down to ingredient size. Each party member discovers they\u0026rsquo;ve been transformed into food items with special abilities:\nFood Transformations:\nBru: Fermented Garlic Bulb - Bold, stinky, aged to perfection and packing a punch Elspeth: Spiced Turnip Root - Humble, earthy root with a sharp kick Jasper: Cured Wyvern Jerky - Wrinkly, meat-smelling, tough and preserved Silas: Ashen Hell Pepper - Scorched with black veins, grown in volcanic soil, causes hallucinations Helisanna: Aged Moon Milk Cheese - Fine like wine, complex and aromatic Olivia: Celestial Prawn of the Ninth Sea - The most special ingredient (rolled highest) The Cooking Show Setup # The party finds themselves in a twisted cooking competition with three judges:\nCrowley: The familiar fae antagonist, clearly enjoying their torment The Blob: A mysterious entity Mrs. Universe: An ethereal concept of a being (not specifically about beauty) An unseen announcer introduces the deadly cooking contest where \u0026ldquo;the players are the ingredients.\u0026rdquo;\nRound One: The Wok Arena # Combat in the Giant Wok # The first challenge takes place in a massive wok pan with fires raging around the outside. The party faces:\nPrimary Enemy: Chili Basil Golem - A large, tough creature resembling Graveler or Golem, made of spices and covered in green oil\nSecondary Enemies: Two Spice Weasels - Small beast creatures that smell of cayenne pepper and leave trails of paprika dust when injured\nCombat Highlights # Opening Assault: Helisanna dominates with Eldritch Blast, knocking the golem back and dealing fire damage as it bounces off the wok sides.\nCoordinated Attacks: The party demonstrates excellent teamwork:\nOlivia delivers devastating blows with her battle axe and Divine Smite Silas eliminates enemies with precision psychic dagger strikes Bru provides artillery support with his Eldritch Cannon Elspeth contributes consistent damage despite lacking her usual equipment Environmental Hazards: As the combat progresses, the wok begins heating up, forcing dexterity saves to avoid fire damage from falling vegetables and hot surfaces.\nFinishing Moves: Olivia and Jasper coordinate to deliver the killing blow to the chili basil golem through spectacular teamwork.\nRound Two: La Cocina Combativa # The Colosseum Arena # The second round moves to an Italian-themed Colosseum with marinara sauce replacing lava in a checkerboard pattern. The arena features:\nRed marinara \u0026ldquo;lava\u0026rdquo; squares that deal fire damage Obstacles in the form of rolling meatballs Various sauce types with different effects flooding the gutters The Rescue Mission # Red\u0026rsquo;s Predicament: Silas spots their missing party member Red, transformed into a red leek, bound and unconscious on a crostini (small bread) at the far end of the arena.\nThe Bomb Threat: Olivia investigates the area and discovers a pit bomb (olive with explosives) hidden behind the crostini with a burning wick.\nKevin\u0026rsquo;s Sacrifice: Bru\u0026rsquo;s homunculus Kevin attempts to defuse the bomb but fails spectacularly, resulting in his explosion. The announcer assures everyone Kevin is safe but \u0026ldquo;out of the running\u0026rdquo; for now.\nThe Pasta Hydra Battle # Main Antagonist: A massive Pasta Hydra emerges through a hole blown in the Colosseum wall - a spaghetti and noodle-based creature with five heads that grows more heads when damaged.\nSupporting Enemies: Olive Assassins (black and green olives) positioned in the arena\u0026rsquo;s upper seating areas, firing arrows at the party.\nEpic Combat Sequence # Multi-Front Battle: The party faces threats from multiple directions:\nSilas climbs to the upper levels to engage olive assassins with spectacular knife throws Olivia, Jasper, and Bru engage the pasta hydra in melee combat Helisanna and Elspeth provide ranged support Hydra Mechanics: The creature demonstrates classic hydra behavior - when heads are severed, two grow back in their place, escalating from five heads to eventually ten heads during the battle.\nCritical Moments:\nOlivia gets her axe stuck in the creature but rips it free with determination Jasper demonstrates incredible luck with multiple critical hits throughout the combat Silas saves Helisanna from a green olive assassin with precise dagger throws Final Victory: Silas delivers the killing blow by throwing a psychic dagger down the creature\u0026rsquo;s throat, causing it to slice through the hydra from the inside.\nJudge Reactions and Intermission # After each round, the judges provide feedback:\nRound One:\nThe Blob: Found the meal \u0026ldquo;very delicious\u0026rdquo; Miss Universe: \u0026ldquo;It was okay\u0026rdquo; Crowley: \u0026ldquo;I expect more if you\u0026rsquo;re going to make it\u0026rdquo; Round Two:\nThe Blob: \u0026ldquo;I found the meal to be very delicious, actually\u0026rdquo; Miss Universe: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m usually not a big fan, but I liked it\u0026rdquo; Crowley: \u0026ldquo;It was\u0026hellip; Edible. It was okay.\u0026rdquo; Character Development and Combat Performance # Team Coordination # The party demonstrates excellent tactical coordination despite being transformed and lacking some equipment:\nEffective use of flanking positions Creative environmental interactions (using wok physics for extra damage) Coordinated rescue operations Strategic positioning and spell usage Equipment Adaptations # Players adapt to their transformed states:\nSilas can still create psychic daggers Olivia maintains her battle axe (apparently sleeping with it) Elspeth shoots \u0026ldquo;toothpicks\u0026rdquo; instead of bolts for flavor Spell abilities remain largely intact Session Themes and Style # Culinary Combat # The session maintains a consistent food theme throughout:\nEnemies are cooking ingredients (chili basil golem, spice weasels, pasta hydra) Environmental hazards are cooking-related (hot wok, sauce types) Combat descriptions use cooking terminology and puns Arena designs reflect kitchen equipment and dining settings Dream Logic # The surreal nature of the dream allows for:\nImpossible transformations Physics that follow cooking metaphors Absurd but internally consistent rules Crowley\u0026rsquo;s continued psychological torment Session Conclusion and Feedback # DM Learning Experience # Zack acknowledges this was primarily a combat-focused session and receives feedback about the need for more roleplay elements. The session serves as a learning experience for balancing combat and narrative elements.\nTechnical Notes # The session runs longer than expected due to:\nMultiple complex combat encounters Online play moving slower than in-person Detailed environmental interactions Extended tactical discussions Future Planning # The session ends with the party still in the dream scenario, setting up for potential continuation with more roleplay-focused content. Zack indicates plans to extend the experience into a more balanced adventure combining combat with character interaction.\nNotable Combat Mechanics # Food-Themed Abilities # Each transformed character gains special abilities related to their food type, though these aren\u0026rsquo;t fully explored in the combat-heavy session.\nEnvironmental Storytelling # The cooking show format provides a framework for creative combat scenarios while maintaining thematic consistency throughout multiple encounter types.\nHydra Challenge # The pasta hydra encounter demonstrates how classic D\u0026amp;D monsters can be reimagined with creative theming while maintaining their essential mechanical challenges.\nThis interlude showcases the campaign\u0026rsquo;s willingness to experiment with unusual scenarios while maintaining the party\u0026rsquo;s core dynamic and Crowley\u0026rsquo;s ongoing antagonistic presence in their adventures.\n","date":"2 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-8/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party finds themselves transformed into food ingredients in a twisted cooking show competition hosted by Crowley.","title":"Interlude VIII: Cooking Combat Chaos","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # Toonlock treats the party to a well-deserved rest and relaxation trip at the Lotus Hotel and Casino, a flashy but lower-budget version of his own realm. The party enjoys spa treatments, shopping, gambling, and entertainment, but their night of revelry leads to a classic \u0026ldquo;hangover\u0026rdquo; scenario where they must piece together the previous evening\u0026rsquo;s events while dealing with the chaotic aftermath.\nArrival at the Lotus Hotel and Casino # The party arrives through a portal that opens and closes every 24 hours, giving them a strict time limit for their stay. They\u0026rsquo;re greeted by Marvin Jr. Jr. Jr., the nerdy great-grandson of the casino\u0026rsquo;s founder, who provides them with gold cards loaded with 100 gold pieces for gambling and access to all amenities.\nAvailable Activities:\nCasino with various gambling games Spa with massages, mud baths, saunas, and hot tubs Shopping for fancy clothes Roller rink and bowling alley Bar with open mic nights Magic show featuring an owlbear named FooFoo Cuddly Poop Mad Goon concert (the campaign\u0026rsquo;s equivalent of Daft Punk) Spa Shenanigans # The party decides to clean up at the spa after their recent adventures:\nThe Mud Bath Prank # Silas and Bru devise an elaborate prank to scare Red while he\u0026rsquo;s relaxing in the mud bath. They plan to hide underwater and emerge as \u0026ldquo;mud monsters\u0026rdquo; while setting off explosives for dramatic effect.\nExecution:\nBoth succeed on stealth rolls to hide in the mud undetected Bru rigs fireworks from Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s stage equipment The explosives work too well, creating a massive mess that covers the entire spa area Mud gets blown everywhere, including into the hot tub where Silas and Jasper are soaking Consequences: A muscular half-orc spa worker (later revealed as Naomi) has to shut down the entire spa for deep cleaning, forcing everyone to evacuate.\nEvening Entertainment # Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s Performance # Helisanna signs up for open mic night at the bar, performing solo acoustic versions of her metal songs including \u0026ldquo;Ogre Skulls\u0026rdquo; and teasing \u0026ldquo;Vampire Viscera.\u0026rdquo; Her performance goes well despite the dark subject matter, with the audience appreciating the musical quality.\nSilas\u0026rsquo;s Scam # While Helisanna performs, Silas runs a charity scam, claiming she has a deadly disease and collecting donations for her \u0026ldquo;treatment.\u0026rdquo; His deception roll of 24 convinces the entire bar, earning them 80 gold in sympathy donations.\nJasper\u0026rsquo;s Gambling Disaster # Jasper immediately heads to the casino and plays a dice game called \u0026ldquo;craps\u0026rdquo; (fantasy version). True to his all-or-nothing barbarian nature:\nHe loses 29 gold in the first few rounds Decides to bet everything (95 gold) on red Loses everything in spectacular fashion Returns to the group completely broke after only a few minutes Shopping Spree # The party visits the upscale shop Paraseldora to dress for the evening:\nOutfit Choices:\nOlivia: Sharp three-piece pinstripe suit with fedora and feather Red: Ornate kimono-style robes with large beaded necklace Bru: Comic version of a white suit similar to Colonel Sanders Helisanna: Gothic dress with ornate black cloak and \u0026ldquo;peekaboo action\u0026rdquo; Silas: White summer suit with black tie and straw hat (Colonel Sanders style) Jasper: Settles for a robe after his gambling losses The Fateful Toast # The evening culminates when Marvin Jr. Jr. Jr. joins them for celebratory shots of top-shelf blue alcohol. Despite Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s paranoid suspicions about being roofied, everyone except Olivia drinks the shots, leading to a complete blackout.\nThe Hangover Morning # The party wakes up in their completely trashed hotel suite with no memory of the previous night:\nRoom Damage Assessment # Discovered Chaos:\nFire burning in the sink Lobby statue dressed in pieces of their clothing Feathers scattered everywhere Ungodly amount of snacks covering all surfaces BoxBox hanging from the chandelier tied up with a feather boa Mattress and blanket fort in the corner Bru wearing only a shirt as pants (legs through arm holes) The Baby Mystery # Jasper discovers a half-orc baby named Julius in Olivia\u0026rsquo;s room, crying in a bassinet. The party initially panics, thinking Olivia has been turned into a baby, before realizing it\u0026rsquo;s a completely different person.\nThe Bathroom Surprise # Bru and Elspeth investigate loud snoring and discover FooFoo Cuddly Poop, a massive owlbear, sleeping peacefully in the jacuzzi tub.\nMatching Tattoos # Bru and Helisanna wake up with matching \u0026ldquo;Live, Laugh, Love\u0026rdquo; tramp stamps in loopy script, apparently gotten while blackout drunk.\nThe Investigation Begins # Missing Olivia # The party initially believes Olivia is dead because her room is suspiciously neat compared to the chaos elsewhere. They search frantically while dealing with the immediate crises.\nThe Owlbear Situation # Mike Bison, a legendary wrestler with a moving dragon tattoo, arrives with two Warforged bodyguards demanding the return of his owlbear. FooFoo is needed for the magic show in 30 minutes, and Mike Bison has a wrestling match to attend.\nThe party successfully lures FooFoo out of the bathroom using:\nBags of snacks as bait A feather boa as a cat toy Silas\u0026rsquo;s psychic daggers formed into mobile-like lights Surveillance Footage # Click and Clack (the Warforged) show the party security footage revealing their theft of FooFoo the previous night. The footage shows:\nOlivia was alive and with them during the initial tour Bru and Silas had an owlbear race, with Bru riding FooFoo and Silas riding Red (in owlbear form) Kevin was used as a sushi roll lure to entice FooFoo to race Elspeth officiated the race Bru won the race with a roll of 19 vs Silas\u0026rsquo;s 18 The Angry Gnome Incident # The Coffin Discovery # While searching backstage, the party finds a gnome tied up in a coffin, wearing only underwear. The gnome immediately attacks them, screaming about his stolen chips.\nThe Gnome\u0026rsquo;s Story:\nClaims the party stole his golden chips while walking past his table Has been chasing them all night with his friends Was eventually knocked unconscious and stuffed in the coffin Demands his chips back before his friends arrive for revenge The Magical Doritos # Investigation reveals the \u0026ldquo;chips\u0026rdquo; are magical golden triangular chips that look like gold-dusted Doritos. These provide +3 Charisma for 15 minutes but are cursed with:\nMild cheese addiction Constitution saves every 5 minutes or compulsion to eat another 40 chips total in the bag, guaranteeing eventual overconsumption Resolution # The party returns the chips to avoid conflict with the gnome\u0026rsquo;s vengeful friends: a buff female tiefling and a blue-skinned male half-orc who arrive to rescue their addicted companion.\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s Reveal # The Truth Emerges # Olivia is discovered perfectly alive and well, having:\nAvoided drinking the roofied shot entirely Gone to bed early after the Mad Goon concert Scheduled and enjoyed a relaxing 2-hour massage appointment Been watching Julius when Naomi needed to work Marvin\u0026rsquo;s Confession # Marvin Jr. Jr. Jr. admits to accidentally roofying the party with a failed experimental potion meant to help them \u0026ldquo;fully recuperate.\u0026rdquo; His incompetence with potion-making runs in the family, explaining the disaster.\nThe Romance Subplot # Silas and Naomi # The party learns that Silas had successfully wooed Naomi, the muscular half-orc spa worker and single mother to baby Julius. Despite his anxiety about whether drunk Silas was more charming than sober Silas, the party helps boost his confidence:\nSupport Spells:\nHelisanna casts Enhanced Ability for advantage on all Charisma checks Red provides Emboldening Bond and Guidance Elspeth serves as wingwoman Successful Reconnection: Naomi agrees to continue seeing Silas, who saves her contact information as \u0026ldquo;Muscle Mommy\u0026rdquo; in his sending stone.\nSession Resolution # Compensation # Marvin Jr. Jr. Jr. comps the party an additional night at the casino as an apology for the accidental drugging, giving them opportunities to:\nActually remember a Mad Goon concert Explore more of the casino amenities Continue the Silas/Naomi romance subplot Character Development # Silas achieves what the party considers \u0026ldquo;the high point of his career\u0026rdquo; by successfully maintaining a relationship with someone clearly out of his league. The running joke about Naomi calling him \u0026ldquo;Sugar Bear\u0026rdquo; becomes a permanent character detail.\nNotable Character Moments # Bru\u0026rsquo;s Chaos # Bru demonstrates his natural affinity for mayhem through:\nThe explosive mud bath prank Stealing and racing an owlbear while blackout drunk His inexplicable ability to find and befriend dangerous animals Wearing clothing in the most impractical way possible Jasper\u0026rsquo;s Gambling Problem # Jasper\u0026rsquo;s immediate loss of all his money establishes him as an \u0026ldquo;all gas, no brakes\u0026rdquo; character who makes impulsive decisions without considering consequences.\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Peer Pressure Susceptibility # Red continues his pattern of being easily influenced by the group, drinking despite his usual abstinence when pressured by his companions.\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s Responsibility # Olivia demonstrates her mature, responsible nature by avoiding the party\u0026rsquo;s chaos and maintaining her commitments (massage appointment) while still helping care for Julius.\nRunning Gags and Callbacks # Bru\u0026rsquo;s Name Mystery # The ongoing mystery of Bru\u0026rsquo;s real first name continues, with increasingly ridiculous guesses including \u0026ldquo;Colonel,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Fart,\u0026rdquo; and Silas\u0026rsquo;s fabricated \u0026ldquo;Piss Whistle.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Brown Obsession # Bru\u0026rsquo;s love of the mysterious drink \u0026ldquo;Brown\u0026rdquo; reaches new heights as he modifies even premium shots to include it, maintaining that all Brown is \u0026ldquo;chewy.\u0026rdquo;\nJasper\u0026rsquo;s Suspicious Behavior # The party begins building a case that Jasper might be a werewolf based on:\nHis destroyed robes (from transformation?) His mention of \u0026ldquo;handling many orphans\u0026rdquo; in ominous ways His love of magic shows (supposedly a werewolf trait) Never being seen with actual werewolves Session Themes # This interlude successfully captures classic \u0026ldquo;hangover\u0026rdquo; comedy while advancing character relationships and providing comedic relief from the main campaign\u0026rsquo;s serious threats. The session demonstrates how the party\u0026rsquo;s different personalities lead to both chaos and unexpected successes when their inhibitions are lowered.\nEllis (Taylor) effectively uses the hangover premise to explore character dynamics through both their blackout actions and their sober attempts to piece together the night, creating memorable moments that will likely be referenced throughout future sessions.\nThe Silas/Naomi romance subplot provides genuine character development while the various mysteries (baby, owlbear, angry gnome) create a perfect blend of comedy and adventure that showcases each character\u0026rsquo;s problem-solving approach.\n","date":"25 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-7/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party enjoys a wild night at a magical casino, only to wake up with no memory and a series of increasingly bizarre problems to solve.","title":"Interlude VII: The Lotus Hotel Hangover","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # The party returns to Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s realm with all three required items (the mask, priest\u0026rsquo;s stole, and mystical dagger) to help him sever his connection to the astral tree and escape Crowley\u0026rsquo;s assault. What follows is a series of intense battles and a climactic confrontation with Crowley himself.\nOpening Recap and Ogre Guardian Battle # The session begins with a recap of the party\u0026rsquo;s journey through The Hollow swamp, including their passage through magical fog, cliff climbing, spider encounters, and bridge crossing. As they approached the Wichita Sisters\u0026rsquo; cave, they discovered what appeared to be a moss-covered boulder was actually a massive ogre-like creature (similar to a Hinox from Breath of the Wild) that served as the cave\u0026rsquo;s guardian.\nCombat: The Cave Guardian # The massive creature, wielding an uprooted tree as a club, engaged the party in brutal combat:\nOpening Moves:\nJasper charges in with his greatsword, dealing solid damage while invoking Eldora\u0026rsquo;s name Red casts Spirit Guardians, surrounding himself with spectral Goliath warriors Elspeth opens fire with her magical gun, dealing consistent damage Tactical Highlights:\nHelisanna successfully casts Tasha\u0026rsquo;s Hideous Laughter, incapacitating the ogre for a crucial turn Silas struggles with his attacks but eventually lands significant hits Bru deploys his Eldritch Cannon and uses Faerie Fire, outlining the creature in blue light for advantage Devastating Counterattack: The ogre performs a massive tree swing that catches multiple party members, dealing 25 damage to those who fail their strength saves and knocking Red prone.\nFinal Assault:\nOlivia delivers a spectacular finishing blow, dealing 51 damage with a critical hit enhanced by Divine Smite She describes cutting the ogre\u0026rsquo;s legs out from under him, then repeatedly smashing his head with a goblin skull while using her battle axe Post-Combat and Loot # After defeating the guardian, the party takes trophies:\nElspeth carves off ogre ivory (teeth/bone) for crafting purposes Red demonstrates his new Returning weapon enchantment on his tomahawk Bru provides everyone with temporary hit points using his cannon\u0026rsquo;s protective mode Return to Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s Realm # Arriving back at Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s realm, the party finds it under heavy assault and barely holding together. The walls are destroyed, facilities smashed, and skeleton minions running in panic.\nCombat: Tweedledee and Tweedledum # Two massive (15-foot tall) humanoid creatures resembling Tweedledee and Tweedledum in schoolboy caps and red overalls attack the party:\nEnemy Abilities:\nBite attacks that deal both physical and psychic damage with nightmare imagery Powerful punches that knock targets prone Coordinated assault on the front-line fighters Party Performance:\nHelisanna attempts Command but fails against their wisdom saves Silas flanks effectively, dealing 28 damage with sneak attacks and precision strikes Red supports with Emboldening Bond and Spiritual Weapon Jasper rages and delivers consistent greatsword damage Olivia devastates one creature with 49 damage using Divine Smite and weapon mastery Bru provides artillery support with his Force Ballista and Firebolt Elspeth and BoxBox coordinate to deliver the killing blow on the second creature Joel\u0026rsquo;s Dramatic Rescue # As the caterpillar creature (from previous encounters) looms over the party with a cigarette holder weapon, it suddenly freezes in pain. Joel explodes out of the creature\u0026rsquo;s stomach in a spectacular display, calmly retrieving his cowboy hat and holstering his gun before stumbling slightly and ruining the cool moment.\nJoel appears exhausted from non-stop fighting but warns the party that Crowley is approaching and they need to get to Toonlock immediately.\nCrowley\u0026rsquo;s Intimidation # As the party rushes toward Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s sanctum, Crowley appears, walking calmly with his hands behind his back. His unnervingly familiar whistle pierces the air as Joel desperately tries to hold him off, urging the party to run.\nThe Ritual Chamber # Inside Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s sanctum, the party finds the fox-like being emaciated and sitting in a lotus pose within a magical sigil. He explains they must work quickly as he can only suppress Crowley temporarily.\nThe Severance Ritual # Toonlock begins the dangerous ritual to sever his realm from the astral tree:\nHe dons the mask (like Daredevil\u0026rsquo;s first season hood) Wraps the priest\u0026rsquo;s stole around his shoulders Takes the mystical dagger in hand The scene swirls into mist, transporting them inside the astral tree itself, where Toonlock must sacrifice part of himself to complete the separation.\nCombat: The Tree\u0026rsquo;s Guardian # As Toonlock begins drawing magical sigils, the astral tree fights back, manifesting a massive humanoid shape made of vines and bark that screams its defiance.\nEnemy Characteristics:\nOak tree-sized manifestation with devastating attacks Life-draining roots that attempt to burrow into party members Massive reach allowing it to attack multiple targets Tactical Combat:\nSilas demonstrates exceptional skill with 43 damage from a critical sneak attack Olivia uses Shining Smite to give the entire party advantage on all attacks Helisanna uses Dissonant Whispers to force the creature to move and provoke opportunity attacks Red supports with Spiritual Weapon and healing while maintaining Emboldening Bond Jasper adapts to ranged combat when the creature moves away Bru deals consistent damage with Force Ballista and Catapult Elspeth lands a critical hit for 25 damage with her magical gun Finishing Move: Red delivers the killing blow with his Returning Tomahawk, describing a slow-motion throw that wedges into the creature before exploding with magical force.\nCrowley\u0026rsquo;s Final Threat # Just as Toonlock is about to complete the ritual, time freezes around everyone. Crowley appears telepathically, making his final offer and threat:\nThe Ultimatum # Crowley reveals he thought their involvement was finished and offers them one last chance to stop Toonlock and \u0026ldquo;earn his forgetfulness.\u0026rdquo; When the party refuses:\nThreats and Revelations:\nHe has captured Caspian and is holding her in his realm He knows all their names, including Red\u0026rsquo;s true name (Thurnok) He makes it clear this is personal now that they\u0026rsquo;ve interfered with his plans Character Interactions:\nOlivia insists on \u0026ldquo;Retired Detective Olivia Cooper\u0026rdquo; rather than first names Silas refuses to engage in conversation due to Crowley\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;creepy voice\u0026rdquo; Helisanna points out his poor definition of \u0026ldquo;friend\u0026rdquo; Bru notes that Crowley knew his name without being told Ritual Completion # After Crowley vanishes, Toonlock completes the ritual by:\nCutting off his own hand with the dagger Using his blood to complete the magical sigil Successfully severing his realm from the astral tree Resolution and Rewards # Back in Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s damaged stronghold, the grateful host provides rewards for the party\u0026rsquo;s service:\nJoel\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Reward\u0026rdquo; # Joel gives each party member an autographed headshot of himself, which the party receives with varying degrees of enthusiasm and confusion.\nToonlock\u0026rsquo;s True Gift # Toonlock grants each party member the Fey-Touched feat, manifesting as fox tattoos on their shoulder blades. This powerful boon provides:\n+1 to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (player\u0026rsquo;s choice) Misty Step spell once per day One level 1 Divination or Enchantment spell once per day Silas immediately chooses Comprehend Languages as his additional spell, demonstrating strategic thinking for future adventures.\nSession Themes and Development # Escalating Threats # The session effectively escalates tension from environmental challenges through increasingly dangerous combat encounters to cosmic-level threats, culminating in Crowley\u0026rsquo;s personal vendetta against the party.\nCharacter Growth # Each party member demonstrates their evolving abilities and personalities:\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s devastating paladin abilities and professional demeanor Silas\u0026rsquo;s precision combat and strategic thinking Red\u0026rsquo;s growing confidence with divine magic and weapon skills Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s tactical spellcasting and performance abilities Bru\u0026rsquo;s artillery expertise and creative problem-solving Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s consistent damage output and mechanical reliability Moral Complexity # The party\u0026rsquo;s decision to help Toonlock despite Crowley\u0026rsquo;s threats shows their commitment to protecting innocent beings, even when it puts them in personal danger.\nOngoing Plot Threads # Crowley\u0026rsquo;s Vendetta: The fae entity now considers the party personal enemies and has their true names Caspian\u0026rsquo;s Capture: The winter goddess\u0026rsquo;s assistant needs rescue from Crowley\u0026rsquo;s realm Joel\u0026rsquo;s Knowledge: The cowboy has information about Crowley that could prove crucial Astral Tree Access: The party\u0026rsquo;s connection to the astral tree provides ongoing adventure opportunities Power Growth: The Fey-Touched feat represents significant character advancement Session Conclusion # This interlude successfully concludes the Toonlock rescue arc while setting up future conflicts with Crowley. The combination of intense combat encounters, character development, and cosmic-level stakes creates a satisfying conclusion that opens new narrative possibilities.\nThe Fey-Touched feat represents not just mechanical advancement but story recognition of the party\u0026rsquo;s heroic actions and their growing connection to otherworldly powers. The session ends with the promise of future adventures as different party members prepare to take turns as DM, using the astral tree as a gateway to infinite possibilities.\nThe successful completion of this mission demonstrates the party\u0026rsquo;s evolution from local troublemakers to cosmic heroes capable of influencing conflicts between powerful otherworldly beings, while Crowley\u0026rsquo;s personal interest in them ensures future adventures will have appropriately high stakes.\n","date":"18 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-6/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party completes their mission to help Toonlock by participating in a dangerous ritual while facing Crowley\u0026rsquo;s final threats and earning powerful rewards.","title":"Interlude VI: The Final Ritual","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # The party continues their journey through The Hollow swamp, pursuing the final item needed to help Toonlock against Crowley\u0026rsquo;s assault on his realm. Their destination: the Wichita Sisters, who possess a mystical dagger required to complete their mission.\nThe Fork in the Road # After surviving the peryton attack and bog wights from the previous session, the party encounters a crucial decision point where the path splits:\nOption 1: Several boats tied to trees at the edge of a deep body of water, offering a direct route across Option 2: A path leading into thick, magically opaque fog Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s Deception # Elspeth investigates the boats (rolling 14) and determines they appear seaworthy with no obvious holes or damage. However, Helisanna immediately claims the boats are \u0026ldquo;obviously sinking\u0026rdquo; and rolls an impressive 26 on deception, convincing most of the party that the boats are unsafe.\nSilas attempts to see through the deception with insight but fails to beat Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s roll. Bru, with his high perception, can clearly see the boats are floating perfectly fine, but the party trusts Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s dramatic assessment over his technical expertise.\nJourney Through the Magical Fog # Rope Safety Measures # The party decides to enter the fog despite Bru\u0026rsquo;s reservations. Silas provides 50 feet of rope, and they tie themselves together in a line with about 15 feet between each person:\nMarching Order: Jasper → Olivia → Bru → Red → Silas → Elspeth → Helisanna\nSilas ties the knots using his survival skills, creating what the DM describes as \u0026ldquo;boy scout quality\u0026rdquo; knots - reliable but not perfect.\nThe Fear Effect # As the party enters the fog, they experience an eerie silence - no animals, no wind, complete opacity even for those with darkvision. The fog creates a supernatural dread that forces wisdom saving throws:\nFailed Saves (overcome by terror and compulsion to flee):\nBru: Attempts to run back down the path Silas: Also tries to escape, dragging Red behind him Jasper: Becomes disoriented and tries to run into the swamp Successful Saves: Red, Helisanna, Olivia, and Elspeth maintain their composure.\nThe Grappling Sequence # What follows is an extended grappling sequence as the unaffected party members try to restrain their panicked companions:\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Struggle: Despite being a large Goliath, Red gets pulled along by Silas and Bru due to their coordinated panic (they\u0026rsquo;re both pulling in the same direction). Red eventually manages to get to his feet with a dirty 20 athletics roll.\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s Wrestling Mastery: Olivia demonstrates exceptional wrestling skills, repeatedly defeating Jasper in opposed athletics checks with rolls including a natural 20. She maintains control throughout the encounter using what the party jokes are her \u0026ldquo;water aerobics\u0026rdquo; training benefits.\nCreative Solutions:\nElspeth and BoxBox successfully capture Bru through coordinated grappling Helisanna attempts multiple grapples on Silas but fails repeatedly as he proves too slippery Red tries slapping Silas to snap him out of it (dealing 2 damage) but this only makes Silas more panicked Breaking the Compulsion # Elspeth uses Message to telepathically contact Silas, telling him \u0026ldquo;Silas, you\u0026rsquo;re being charmed. Come back.\u0026rdquo; Her persuasion roll of 21 allows Silas another wisdom save, which he passes, returning to normal.\nSilas then uses his Psychic Phone to contact Bru, rolling persuasion with a psychic die to reach 20 total. This grants Bru another wisdom save, which he initially fails (rolling 4) but uses inspiration to reroll, achieving 21 and breaking free of the effect.\nThe Cliff Challenge # The Boiling Waters # The party encounters another obstacle: a 30-foot wide stretch of bubbling, steaming water that proves to be highly acidic. When they throw a rock into it, it violently sizzles and dissolves, confirming the water is too dangerous to cross.\nElspeth\u0026rsquo;s Climb # The only option is scaling a 50-foot cliff face. Elspeth volunteers to climb first, using her daggers as climbing aids for advantage on athletics checks. Her climbing progress:\nFirst check (Dirty 20): Climbs 10 feet successfully Second check (19): Reaches 20 feet when spiders emerge from crevices Combat interruption: Six giant spiders attack her position Post-combat: Uses Enhance Ability on her strength and continues climbing Final stretch: Reaches the top safely Spider Combat Encounter # The Ambush # Six giant spiders emerge from crevices in the cliff face, converging on Elspeth while she\u0026rsquo;s vulnerable mid-climb. The encounter tests the party\u0026rsquo;s ability to protect a teammate at range.\nCombat Highlights # Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s Tactical Blasting: Uses Eldritch Blast with Repelling Blast to knock spiders away from Elspeth, buying time and creating space.\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Projectile Mastery: Throws his tomahawk at the spiders, rolling a natural 20 for a devastating critical hit (25 damage total), cleanly bisecting one spider. The axe returns to his hand thanks to Bru\u0026rsquo;s recent Returning weapon infusion.\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s Ranged Redemption: After previous sessions of poor marksmanship, Olivia has an excellent showing:\nNatural 20 with her gun, eliminating one spider Follow-up shot for 8 damage to another spider Demonstrates her detective training is finally paying off Silas\u0026rsquo;s Precision Strikes: Uses his psychic daggers to eliminate multiple spiders with sneak attacks, including dramatic finishing moves like daggers \u0026ldquo;right up its ass.\u0026rdquo;\nBru\u0026rsquo;s Artillery Support: Deploys his Eldritch Cannon in Force Ballista mode, providing consistent damage and tactical positioning with push effects.\nCombat Resolution # The party successfully eliminates all six spiders through coordinated ranged attacks, with the final spider attempting to flee but being gunned down before escape. Elspeth successfully reaches the top of the cliff without taking significant damage.\nThe Rope Bridge Crossing # Establishing the Route # Elspeth secures a rope to a bridge post at the top of the cliff and throws it down for the others to climb. Her survival check of 17 (after using inspiration to reroll) creates a solid \u0026ldquo;boy scout quality\u0026rdquo; knot.\nGroup Climbing Sequence # The 50-foot rope hangs about 3 feet above ground, requiring jumping for shorter party members:\nClimbing Results:\nBru: Dirty 20 - climbs easily despite his small size Olivia: 18 - solid performance Jasper: Dirty 20 - excellent technique Helisanna: Dirty 20 - smooth ascent Red: Natural 20 first roll, 13 second (takes 13) - clumsy spinning climb that embarrasses him Silas: Rolls poorly (around 3) and decides to tie the rope around his waist for the others to pull him up Testing the Returning Axe # Bru tests his new infusion by having Red throw his axe over the cliff edge. The axe successfully returns to Red\u0026rsquo;s hand, though they discover an important limitation: the returning property only works for the attuned wielder, not just anyone who throws it.\nBridge Crossing # The party examines the rope bridge carefully with perception checks. Silas and Bru both roll well (23 and high teens) and determine the bridge is structurally sound with no obvious traps or deterioration.\nBru volunteers to cross first, strutting confidently across without incident. The rest of the party follows successfully, with the bridge easily supporting even Red\u0026rsquo;s considerable weight.\nArrival at the Hollow # The Cave of Ominous Portents # The party finally reaches their destination: a depression in the ground containing a cave entrance. The area is appropriately ominous:\nEnvironmental Details:\nLarge gnarled trees and boulders scattered around Misty, swampy atmosphere with limited visibility Torches lit at the cave entrance A canopy of crossing branches overhead Goblin Skull Decorations: Most disturbing to Bru, the cave entrance is lined with goblin skulls that somehow appear to be frowning rather than showing the typical skull \u0026ldquo;grin.\u0026rdquo; The skulls look genuinely unhappy, suggesting these goblins died in distress.\nBru\u0026rsquo;s Reaction: Despite the macabre display of his own species\u0026rsquo; remains, Bru finds the cave entrance \u0026ldquo;cozier than that mansion we were in,\u0026rdquo; showing his chaotic goblin sensibilities.\nPre-Cave Preparations # Party Status Check # The party assesses their readiness before entering:\nElspeth: Down 11 HP but functional Jasper: Near full health Olivia: Full health Others: Generally in good condition Decision: Proceed without a short rest Red\u0026rsquo;s Emboldening Bond # Red attempts to cast Emboldening Bond on three party members but encounters an unexpected problem: the spell requires the targets to be \u0026ldquo;willing creatures at peace with one another.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Friendship Test: When asked mechanically whether she considers Bru and Silas friends, Helisanna reveals she views them as \u0026ldquo;employees\u0026rdquo; rather than friends, maintaining professional distance despite their shared dangers.\nEmotional Impact: Bru is visibly hurt by this revelation, showing teary eyes at not being considered a friend. Helisanna maintains that she needs to \u0026ldquo;keep it professional.\u0026rdquo;\nSpell Resolution: Red ends up connecting only Silas and Bru with the bond, as Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s refusal to consider them friends prevents her from benefiting.\nThe Guardian Awakens # The Hinox Revelation # As the party approaches within 30 feet of the cave entrance, what appeared to be a moss-covered boulder begins to stir. A massive ogre-like creature - described as similar to a Hinox from Breath of the Wild but with two eyes - slowly stands up.\nPhysical Description:\nColossal size, covered in moss and dirt Two eyes (unlike the typical one-eyed Hinox) Vegetation and debris falling off as it moves Reaches over to uproot an entire tree to use as a club Cliffhanger Ending: The session ends just as initiative is about to be rolled, with this massive guardian blocking their path to the Wichita Sisters and the dagger they desperately need.\nCharacter Development and Themes # Trust and Deception # Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s successful deception about the boats highlights ongoing trust issues within the party. Her willingness to mislead her companions for unknown reasons raises questions about her reliability and decision-making.\nProfessional vs. Personal Relationships # The revelation that Helisanna views her bandmates as employees rather than friends creates tension and hurt feelings, particularly affecting Bru who clearly desires closer relationships with his companions.\nIndividual Competencies # The session showcases each character\u0026rsquo;s growing expertise:\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s wrestling and shooting skills Silas\u0026rsquo;s stealth and precision combat abilities Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s climbing and technical problem-solving Red\u0026rsquo;s weapon throwing and supportive magic Bru\u0026rsquo;s artillery and magical engineering Team Coordination # Despite interpersonal tensions, the party demonstrates excellent tactical coordination during the spider encounter, showing their growth as a combat unit even when personal relationships remain complicated.\nOngoing Plot Threads # The Wichita Sisters: The party must still reach and negotiate with these mysterious figures for the dagger The Massive Guardian: A significant combat encounter awaits before they can enter the cave Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s War: Time pressure continues as Crowley maintains his assault Party Dynamics: Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s emotional distance creates ongoing interpersonal challenges Crowley\u0026rsquo;s Master Plan: The completion of this third trial will determine their ability to help Toonlock Session Conclusion # This session effectively builds tension through environmental challenges, interpersonal drama, and escalating threats. The progression from deception through teamwork to revelation of deeper character issues creates a strong narrative arc, while the cliffhanger ending with the massive guardian promises an epic confrontation to begin the next session.\nThe party\u0026rsquo;s journey through The Hollow demonstrates both their growing tactical sophistication and their ongoing struggles with trust and communication, setting up compelling conflicts both external (the guardian) and internal (friendship vs. professionalism) for future sessions.\n","date":"4 April 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-5/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party navigates treacherous fog and spider-infested cliffs to reach the Wichita Sisters\u0026rsquo; cave, only to face a massive guardian at the entrance.","title":"Interlude V: The Wichita Sisters' Guardian","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # The party continues their mission to help Toonlock defend his realm from Crowley\u0026rsquo;s assault by retrieving the third and final item needed: a mystical dagger held by the mysterious Wichita Sisters deep in a dangerous swamp called The Hollow.\nPre-Session Recovery # After successfully freeing the tortured angel from the vampire convent and obtaining the priest\u0026rsquo;s stole, the party returns to Lakeshore Vale (the astral tree village) where they are celebrated as heroes for ending the nightly monster attacks.\nJasper\u0026rsquo;s Healing: Red uses his prepared Remove Curse spell to heal Jasper of the mummy rot that had been slowly killing him, though the barbarian still needs additional rest to fully recover his health. Red delivers a brief monologue about redemption and second chances while performing the healing.\nThe party takes a long rest, with everyone except Jasper receiving the full benefits. Helisanna performs music for the grateful villagers, providing heroic inspiration to several party members.\nEntering The Hollow # The Portal Transition # The party uses Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s magic to travel to The Hollow, emerging through a moss-covered portal on the astral tree into a classic haunted swamp environment reminiscent of old Scooby-Doo cartoons.\nEnvironmental Details:\nAnkle-deep boggy water immediately upon arrival Dense fog rolling over different areas Red casts Light to illuminate their surroundings A naturally formed earthen path leading away from their arrival point The Frog Village # Following the path, the party discovers a swamp village built on stilts with wooden walkways connecting elevated homes. The settlement is populated entirely by frog people who initially ignore the party\u0026rsquo;s presence.\nMeeting the Banjo Player # The party encounters a human musician on his front porch playing banjo poorly. Key details about him:\nWears a wide-brimmed hat pulled low over his eyes Has cataracts covering his eyes Smokes a corncob pipe Plays with only two strings on his banjo Helisanna is openly critical of his musical abilities, while the others attempt to gather information about their quest.\nInformation Gathering # The banjo player provides crucial intelligence about their destination:\nThe Wichita Sisters do indeed possess the dagger they seek The sisters live deep in the heart of the swamp The journey is extremely dangerous - most who visit them for \u0026ldquo;non-social calls\u0026rdquo; end up dead Two possible routes: an overland path through magical fog, or travel by boat The swamp itself is sentient and changes paths to confuse travelers However, following any fork in the main path will eventually lead to the sisters Strategic Decision: The party chooses the overland route rather than risk boat combat, despite concerns about the magical fog.\nThe Bog of the Dead # Discovery of the Corpses # As the party travels deeper into the swamp, Bru (with his high passive perception) notices disturbing shapes in the water around the path. Investigation reveals:\nThe Dead in the Water:\nDozens of bodies scattered throughout the bog water All wearing armor and carrying adventuring gear from different time periods Bodies appear to be from various locations and eras All corpses have had their hearts ripped out Everything in the water (seaweed, algae, debris) is completely motionless Olivia\u0026rsquo;s investigation (rolling 23) reveals that the water itself appears to be magically stagnant - nothing moves within it, as if frozen in time.\nThe Peryton Ambush # Initial Contact # As the party continues along the path surrounded by the eerie still water and corpses, they encounter flying creatures moving through the trees. Silas spots them first with his high perception, identifying them as humanoid-sized winged creatures positioning themselves for an attack.\nCreature Description:\nPerytons: Eagle-like creatures with antlers protruding from their heads Despite their avian appearance, they cast human-shaped shadows Six creatures total, all diving from the trees Combat Begins # The perytons launch a coordinated assault, with most party members being targeted by diving attacks designed to knock them off the path and into the deadly bog water.\nOpening Round Attacks:\nOlivia: Successfully deflects an attack with her AC 20 Bru: Manages to duck out of the way Helisanna: Takes 18 damage and fails her strength save, getting knocked into the bog Red: Takes 23 damage and is also knocked into the bog water Silas: Avoids being targeted Jasper: Avoids the attack The Bog Awakens # As soon as Helisanna and Red land in the bog water, the previously motionless environment springs to life:\nUndead Emergence: The corpses in the water begin moving, with eyes opening and heads turning toward the living intruders. These wights attempt to drain life force from anyone in the water while wielding ancient weapons.\nEnvironmental Horror: The seaweed, algae, and other bog matter all begin flowing and moving in unnatural ways, creating an atmosphere of supernatural dread.\nMulti-Front Battle # Party Coordination # The combat becomes a desperate fight on multiple fronts:\nRanged Assault:\nBru uses Scorching Ray to target three different perytons, dealing significant damage with his Arcane Firearm Elspeth provides covering fire with her magical gun while BoxBox positions for support Helisanna attempts to escape the water using Misty Step but struggles with concentration underwater Rescue Operations:\nJasper extends his shovel to help Red escape the bog Red successfully grabs the shovel (insight check of 24) and gets pulled out (Jasper\u0026rsquo;s athletics check of 21) Olivia later performs a heroic rescue of Silas when he gets knocked into the bog Tactical Spellcasting # Red\u0026rsquo;s Support: Uses Emboldening Bond to connect allies and later Balm of Peace to heal multiple party members while moving around the battlefield.\nHelisanna\u0026rsquo;s Creative Strategy: Successfully uses Command (upcasted to target two creatures) to make a peryton \u0026ldquo;grovel,\u0026rdquo; causing it to fall into the bog where the wights tear it apart.\nBru\u0026rsquo;s Protection: His Eldritch Cannon provides temporary hit points to the party, which proves crucial for survival.\nCombat Escalation # Silas Nearly Dies: Takes a critical hit for 36 damage, reducing him to only 10 HP and knocking him into the bog alongside Olivia.\nHeroic Rescue: Olivia grabs Silas and pulls both of them out of the water with a successful athletics check (21), then uses Lay on Hands to heal him 10 points, giving him a Werther\u0026rsquo;s candy as flavor.\nElspeth\u0026rsquo;s Precision: Delivers devastating attacks with her magical gun enhanced by Branding Smite, killing multiple perytons with precise headshots.\nVictory and Resolution # Final Eliminations # Team Coordination: The party systematically eliminates the remaining perytons through coordinated attacks:\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Spiritual Weapon scores a critical hit for 17 damage Silas gets revenge with sneak attacks, including a dramatic finishing move Elspeth and BoxBox provide consistent damage output Jasper contributes with crossbow attacks Strategic Retreat: The final surviving peryton, realizing the ambush has completely failed, flees back into the woods rather than face certain death.\nPost-Combat Analysis # Creature Identification: Olivia\u0026rsquo;s Arcana check (17) identifies the creatures as perytons - unnatural monsters shaped by fel magic that consume human hearts. Their strategy involved knocking victims into the bog to let the wights kill them, making heart extraction easier.\nLoot Collection: The party gathers trophies from the defeated perytons:\nHelisanna takes antlers for stage decorations and potential mask-making Bru collects various bones and skulls for props Elspeth acquires feathers for her hair decoration project Session Themes and Development # Environmental Storytelling # The bog serves as an excellent example of environmental horror, with the still water hiding ancient dangers and the corpses of previous adventurers serving as both warning and threat. The juxtaposition of the peaceful frog village against the deadly swamp creates effective tension.\nTactical Growth # The party demonstrates improved tactical coordination, with members supporting each other through rescue operations, strategic positioning, and creative spell usage. The multi-front nature of the combat (flying enemies + underwater undead) tests their adaptability.\nCharacter Moments # Red\u0026rsquo;s Pacifist Struggles: His reluctance to heal Jasper due to his Eldoran background shows ongoing character development around his beliefs versus practical necessity.\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s Heroism: Her decision to rescue Silas rather than save herself demonstrates her protective nature and police background.\nHelisanna\u0026rsquo;s Creativity: Her use of Command to tactical advantage shows growing sophistication in spell usage.\nTeam Bonding: The various rescue operations and mutual support reinforce the party\u0026rsquo;s growing trust and coordination.\nOngoing Plot Threads # The Wichita Sisters: The party must still reach these mysterious figures to obtain the dagger Swamp Navigation: The sentient, path-changing nature of the swamp presents ongoing challenges Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s War: Time pressure remains as Crowley continues his assault The Final Challenge: This dagger represents the last item needed to help Toonlock Session Conclusion # The session ends with the party having successfully survived their first major encounter in The Hollow, but still facing the dangerous journey deeper into the swamp to reach the Wichita Sisters. The combination of environmental hazards, strategic enemies, and time pressure creates mounting tension as they approach the climax of their mission to help Toonlock.\nThe early ending allows for proper rest before tackling what promises to be an even more challenging encounter with the mysterious sisters who possess the final item needed to complete their quest.\n","date":"28 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-4/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party ventures into a treacherous swamp to retrieve the final item needed to help Toonlock, facing deadly perytons and undead in the bog waters.","title":"Interlude IV: Into the Hollow","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # The party continues their infiltration of the vampire convent, completing their mission to retrieve the priest\u0026rsquo;s stole while discovering the horrific truth behind the sanctuary\u0026rsquo;s corruption. What begins as a straightforward combat encounter evolves into a rescue mission for a tortured celestial being.\nEntering the Convent Interior # The Hallway System # After defeating the vampire nuns and weeping angels in the courtyard, the party uses the silver heart-shaped key to enter the convent proper. They find themselves in a T-intersection hallway lined with individual nun cells, each containing evidence of the building\u0026rsquo;s former holy purpose now corrupted by vampire occupation.\nInvestigation Results: Olivia\u0026rsquo;s detective work reveals that this was once a legitimate religious community dedicated to Sylvanus, a forest god. However, the religious items, prayer books, and imagery have all been systematically defiled and vandalized with profane symbols, indicating a deliberate corruption rather than simple abandonment.\nFirst Floor Combat # The party encounters three more vampire nuns attempting to ambush them from the ceiling. Bru\u0026rsquo;s exceptional perception (rolling 18) allows him to detect their movement, leading to a tactical encounter:\nOpening Moves:\nBru uses Pyrotechnics to blind two of the three vampires with fireworks from the ceiling torches Helisanna uses Command to force one vampire to \u0026ldquo;drop\u0026rdquo; from the ceiling, causing fall damage Combat Highlights:\nOlivia demonstrates her effectiveness against undead with radiant damage from Sacred Weapon and Divine Smite Jasper enters rage and delivers devastating greatsword attacks, including a critical hit that bisects a vampire Elspeth provides consistent damage with her magical gun while coordinating with BoxBox Silas uses stealth and precision to eliminate targets with psychic daggers A massive vampire nun bursts through doors at the end of the hallway, described as weighing \u0026ldquo;like a thousand pounds\u0026rdquo; and resembling \u0026ldquo;the mom from Slither.\u0026rdquo; Her belching attack forces constitution saves and deals significant damage to the front-line fighters.\nThe Mother Superior Encounter # Ascending to the Upper Floor # The party climbs to the second floor, discovering a layout similar to the first but with more ornate chambers. They find the Mother Superior\u0026rsquo;s quarters - a luxurious room with curtains, furniture, and a small shrine, along with the decomposing body of the vampire nun they had sent earlier to retrieve the stole.\nThe Slenderman Nun # The Mother Superior reveals herself as a grotesquely transformed creature:\nUnnaturally elongated arms and legs stretched at the joints Matted, disheveled hair hanging from her habit A veil covering the upper half of her face Long, pointed fangs visible below the veil A gold heart-shaped key hanging around her neck Movement described as unnatural and marionette-like Combat Tactics # Opening Round:\nOlivia uses Channel Divinity for Sacred Weapon, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius Her attacks knock the Mother Superior prone with the Topple weapon mastery Helisanna provides Bardic Inspiration while attacking with Eldritch Blast Mid-Combat Developments:\nThe Mother Superior uses a fear-inducing gaze that frightens Olivia, imposing disadvantage on attacks Jasper takes significant damage from necrotic claw attacks and grappling attempts Bru positions his Eldritch Cannon on Olivia\u0026rsquo;s shoulder for tactical advantage Decisive Moments:\nElspeth uses the Force Ballista to push and damage the creature Bru delivers the killing blow with a Firebolt enhanced by his Arcane Firearm The Mother Superior\u0026rsquo;s habit and curtains catch fire as she crumbles to dust The Vampire Ambush # The Door Defense # As the party defeats the Mother Superior, three more vampire nuns emerge from cells in the hallway behind them. Elspeth and Silas quickly move to hold the door shut, leading to a desperate holding action.\nThe Coordinated Assault # The party develops an elaborate plan for dealing with the vampires:\nThe Plan:\nBru provides Elspeth with dynamite from his seemingly endless supply Elspeth will blast the door with Eldritch Blast Bru primes the door to explode using his criminal experience Red prepares Spirit Guardians for area control Jasper positions for a dramatic aerial attack Bru coordinates his Flaminator cannon to fire through the explosion Execution: Bru\u0026rsquo;s intelligence check (rolling 22) allows him to perfectly time the explosive setup. When the vampires charge the door, it explodes in a spectacular display of dynamite, eldritch energy, and flame, dealing 42 damage to all three creatures.\nFollow-up Attacks: With the vampires stunned and damaged, the party coordinates finishing moves:\nOlivia bisects one vampire with her battle axe Jasper performs a \u0026ldquo;Drax the Destroyer\u0026rdquo; style charge through the explosion debris Silas eliminates the final vampire with dual psychic daggers to the eyes The Chapel of Horrors # The Final Ascent # Using both heart-shaped keys (gold and silver), the party unlocks the ornate doors leading to the convent\u0026rsquo;s chapel. The circular room contains:\nQuarter-circle pews arranged around half the chamber An altar on the far side Stained glass windows A horrifying sight above the altar The Tortured Angel # Hanging above the altar is a deva (lower-tier angel) in a state of extreme mutilation:\nBronze skin covered in cuts and wounds Magnificent wings now tattered Blood dripping from wounds into tubes leading to the Mother Superior\u0026rsquo;s room A black stole wrapped around its torso Eyes that should shine like the sun but glow blood-red with malice Red\u0026rsquo;s religion check (natural 20, total 26) identifies this as a corrupted celestial being, tortured and driven to madness but not inherently evil.\nZero Gravity Combat # As the party enters, supernatural forces activate:\nThe room begins shaking Blood-red moonlight pours through stained glass Gravity ceases to function, causing everyone to float The deva\u0026rsquo;s eyes open and it manifests a mace Combat begins in three-dimensional space Talking Down the Angel # Rather than simply fighting, several party members attempt diplomacy:\nElspeth\u0026rsquo;s Initiative: Despite taking 28 radiant damage from the deva\u0026rsquo;s mace, Elspeth shouts \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re trying to help you, please!\u0026rdquo; Her persuasion roll of 23 opens telepathic contact, revealing the creature\u0026rsquo;s anguish: \u0026ldquo;They took everything. Everything! Make it stop. Make it stop.\u0026rdquo;\nHealing Gesture: Red chooses to cast Healing Word on the tortured angel, restoring it to full health and demonstrating the party\u0026rsquo;s benevolent intentions.\nContinued Diplomacy: Elspeth continues talking to the angel, explaining they want to help and heal it. Her persuasion roll of 22 further calms the creature.\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s Truth: Olivia casts Zone of Truth and speaks honestly about their intentions to help, clear out the vampires, and remove the black stole. Her persuasion roll of 19 with advantage nearly completes the pacification.\nSilas Closes the Deal: Silas delivers a masterful speech acknowledging the angel\u0026rsquo;s justified anger while explaining that the wrongs have already been righted. His persuasion roll of 21 (enhanced with psychic dice) fully calms the celestial being.\nLiberation and Redemption # The Surgical Removal # With the angel pacified, the party carefully removes the cursed stole:\nElspeth warns the angel that the removal will hurt but promises immediate healing Silas provides a clean, sharp knife for the procedure Bru supplies fire to sterilize the blade The stole is revealed to be literally stitched into the angel\u0026rsquo;s skin The Angel\u0026rsquo;s Departure # Once freed, the angel undergoes a transformation:\nIts corrupted appearance begins to return to celestial beauty It speaks telepathically to thank the party It crosses its arms in a \u0026ldquo;Wakanda forever\u0026rdquo; gesture It floats upward and explodes the entire roof of the convent with divine light Dawn breaks over the eastern horizon as the angel ascends Light returns to the accursed place for the first time in ages Mission Accomplished # The party successfully retrieves the priest\u0026rsquo;s stole, completing the second of three challenges needed to help Toonlock against Crowley\u0026rsquo;s assault on his realm.\nCharacter Development and Themes # Moral Complexity # This session showcases the party\u0026rsquo;s growing sophistication in handling morally complex situations. Rather than simply fighting the tortured angel, they recognized it as a victim and chose compassion over combat.\nTeam Coordination # The explosive assault on the vampire ambush demonstrates excellent tactical planning and creative problem-solving, with each party member contributing their unique abilities to a coordinated strategy.\nReligious Implications # Red\u0026rsquo;s choice to heal the tortured angel, despite his complicated relationship with divine beings, shows character growth and commitment to helping the innocent regardless of his personal struggles.\nRedemption and Restoration # The session\u0026rsquo;s climax emphasizes themes of redemption, with the party not only completing their mission but also restoring a corrupted holy site and freeing a tortured celestial being.\nNotable Combat Mechanics # Zero Gravity Fighting # The three-dimensional combat in the chapel required creative positioning and movement, with players adapting to unusual environmental conditions.\nCoordinated Area Attacks # The explosive assault demonstrated how multiple different damage types and effects could be combined for devastating area-of-effect attacks.\nSocial Encounter Resolution # The angel encounter showed how combat could be resolved through roleplay and persuasion rather than violence, rewarding creative thinking and empathy.\nSession Conclusion # With the second trial completed, the party has proven their ability to handle both direct combat and complex moral situations. The destruction of the vampire convent and liberation of the tortured angel provide both mechanical success (acquiring the stole) and narrative satisfaction (righting ancient wrongs).\nThe session ends with the party having completed two of three challenges needed to help Toonlock, setting up the final trial while demonstrating their growing capabilities as both warriors and heroes capable of showing mercy to the innocent while eliminating true evil.\nOngoing Plot Threads # The Third Trial: One final challenge remains to complete their assistance to Toonlock Crowley\u0026rsquo;s Schemes: The fae entity\u0026rsquo;s assault on Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s realm continues Angel Ally: The freed deva may return as an ally in future adventures Divine Corruption: The systematic torture of celestial beings suggests broader supernatural threats This interlude successfully balanced horror elements with heroic redemption, showcasing both the party\u0026rsquo;s combat effectiveness and their moral development as they choose compassion over expedience when facing a tortured innocent.\n","date":"14 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-3/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party completes their infiltration of the vampire convent, facing a monstrous Mother Superior and freeing a tortured angel from its cursed bonds.","title":"Interlude III: The Corrupted Sanctuary","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Clarifying Note # This session takes place after the masquerade and before the vampire convent.\nThe Birthday Invitation # The session begins at the astral tree village where Isla approaches the party with an unexpected invitation. She has received word about her grandfather Thalrock Embermore\u0026rsquo;s 88th birthday party on her home plane of Luminaria. Due to time flowing differently between planes, Isla has missed ten years of family gatherings during her time away.\nThe invitation extends to \u0026ldquo;Taco Cat,\u0026rdquo; though Thalrock himself doesn\u0026rsquo;t recall inviting them. The party learns that invitations are managed by Laura, the family\u0026rsquo;s event planner, who allows family members to add guests to the list freely.\nArrival at Luminaria # The party travels through a portal surrounded by glowing mushrooms, emerging onto the moss-covered grounds of the Embermore Manor. The plane exists in perpetual dusk with pink and purple skies, and every step on the moss causes it to glow softly. Bru immediately eats one of the glowing mushrooms, causing his belly to emit a warm light from within.\nThe manor itself is an impressive estate housing about 30 guests, primarily Goliaths and elves representing the extended family network.\nMeeting the Family # Thalrock Embermore, the 88th-year-old patriarch, greets them warmly despite not remembering the invitation. The party meets several key family members:\nKale: Isla\u0026rsquo;s step-brother, a beautiful elven man who has been managing family affairs during Isla\u0026rsquo;s absence Iridesa: Kale\u0026rsquo;s wife, described as having an \u0026ldquo;Instagram model\u0026rdquo; appearance with an unnaturally perfect look Orithiel: The family matriarch with severe features and a perpetual stern expression Aelin and Vale: Twin goth elven girls who are immediate fans of Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s music During dinner conversation, family tensions become apparent. Thalrock appears frail and has been coughing frequently, while Iridesa seems overly dramatic in her reactions.\nThe Murder Mystery Becomes Real # As Thalrock raises a toast with red wine, he suddenly collapses at the dinner table, coughing up blood with black tendrils visible on his neck. Retired Detective Olivia Cooper immediately springs into action, using her investigative skills to examine the scene.\nKey Evidence Discovered # Olivia\u0026rsquo;s investigation reveals:\nBlack veins visible under Thalrock\u0026rsquo;s skin near his neck A black film coating the wine glass, identified by Isla as bloodthorn poison The poison builds up over time, requiring long-term administration Isla reveals she\u0026rsquo;s been treating Thalrock with healing salves applied to bandages on his neck The revelation that Isla has been tending to exactly where the poison symptoms appear immediately makes Orithiel suspicious, leading to accusations that Isla killed her grandfather upon returning home.\nThe Investigation Unfolds # Evidence Collection Phase # The party conducts a thorough investigation of the manor:\nKitchen Discovery: All wine bottles intended for the evening contain the same black poison, with needle marks in the corks indicating systematic tampering.\nOffice Investigation: In Thalrock\u0026rsquo;s study, they discover:\nA recently written will leaving everything to Kale, written in shaky handwriting Helisanna finds burned paper fragments in the fireplace Olivia reconstructs the original will, revealing it originally split inheritance four ways between Isla, Kale, and the twins Bedroom Searches:\nIn Kale\u0026rsquo;s room: Black-stained handkerchiefs indicating he\u0026rsquo;s also been poisoned, but recently In Orithiel\u0026rsquo;s room: A book of dark magic focusing on resurrection spells, with residue traces leading toward the sewing room The Sewing Room Discovery: Behind a locked door, they find an complete apothecary setup containing:\nBloodthorn poison in vials Isla\u0026rsquo;s healing ingredients (explaining how she could access them) Spell components for necromantic rituals Confronting the Family # Medical Examinations # Red and Bru attempt to examine family members for signs of poisoning, leading to chaotic scenes as they try to collect saliva samples from reluctant relatives. Their investigation reveals that Orithiel and Kale both show signs of long-term poisoning exposure.\nThe Accusations Fly # Olivia presents the evidence systematically:\nThe forged will giving everything to Kale The destroyed original will The systematic poisoning of wine bottles The apothecary setup in the locked sewing room Kale\u0026rsquo;s symptoms of recent poisoning When confronted, Iridesa becomes increasingly agitated and defensive. Helisanna attempts to use Detect Thoughts on her, discovering strange mental patterns focused on feeling \u0026ldquo;itchy\u0026rdquo; and uncomfortable.\nThe Shapeshifter Revealed # As the evidence mounts and the family begins turning suspicious eyes toward Iridesa, she finally snaps. Screaming that the party was \u0026ldquo;supposed to be stupid\u0026rdquo; and referencing their previous encounter at \u0026ldquo;the masquerade with the fae dancing,\u0026rdquo; Iridesa reveals her true nature by shapeshifting into a night hag.\nThe transformation reveals:\nHer \u0026ldquo;perfect\u0026rdquo; appearance was magical disguise She has been systematically poisoning the family for years Her plan involved eliminating Thalrock and other heirs to claim the inheritance through Kale She has knowledge of the party\u0026rsquo;s previous adventures, suggesting broader connections Combat: The Night Hag Battle # Initiative and Opening Moves # The night hag immediately attacks with Ray of Enfeeblement targeting Olivia, who successfully resists. Red opens with Emboldening Bond, connecting himself, Bru, and Olivia with divine energy that provides combat bonuses.\nOlivia charges in with her battle axe, using Divine Smite to deal massive radiant damage and successfully knocking the hag prone with her weapon mastery abilities.\nEscalating Threats # Helisanna casts Hex on the night hag before attacking with her guitar axe, adding necrotic damage to her strikes. Just as the battle begins to favor the party, two etter caps crash through the dining room windows, climbing onto the ceiling and adding aerial threats to the encounter.\nTactical Combat # Red deploys Spirit Guardians, filling the dining room with spectral Goliath warriors wielding tomahawks. The 15-foot radius effect covers most of the room, forcing wisdom saves from all enemies.\nBru deploys his Eldritch Cannon in force ballista mode, dealing significant damage and using the push effect to keep enemies at range. When one etter cap webs him, Red uses his weapon to free his ally with a critical hit that completely destroys the restraints.\nOlivia proves devastatingly effective against undead creatures, her radiant damage cutting through the night hag\u0026rsquo;s defenses while her protective abilities keep the party alive.\nFinishing Moves # Helisanna eliminates the first etter cap with coordinated Eldritch Blast attacks, causing it to explode in fiery webs and goo. Bru follows up with Shatter, using thunder damage to destroy the second etter cap by causing its eyes to roll back and blood to pour from its ears.\nThe night hag falls to Bru\u0026rsquo;s force ballista, which launches her corpse across the room to splatter against the wall, leaving a trail of slime across the damaged floor.\nResolution and Rewards # Family Reconciliation # With the threat eliminated, the family processes the revelation that Iridesa was a supernatural predator who had infiltrated their household. Kale realizes the numerous red flags he had ignored, including her mysterious appearance from the woods and unexplained absences.\nOrithiel, despite her severe demeanor, formally thanks the party for saving her family and offers them the prizes that were meant for the original murder mystery game.\nDetective-Themed Rewards # The party receives magical items themed around detective work:\nSmoking Jacket (taken by Helisanna): Provides +1 to Charisma, perfect for her performance career Hat of Disguise (taken by Red for Elspeth): Allows casting of Disguise Self while worn Eyes of Minute Seeing (taken by Olivia): Provides advantage on Intelligence checks relying on sight Pipe of Smoke Monsters (taken by Bru): Creates smoke illusions in the shape of creatures for entertainment Thematic Connections # The party realizes this encounter connects to their previous adventures, particularly their experience at the fae masquerade. The night hag\u0026rsquo;s knowledge of their past suggests they may be dealing with connected threats across different planes.\nSession Themes and Impact # This interlude successfully blends classic murder mystery elements with D\u0026amp;D fantasy, allowing Olivia\u0026rsquo;s detective background to shine while providing each character opportunities to contribute their unique skills. The session demonstrates the party\u0026rsquo;s growing effectiveness at both investigation and combat encounters.\nThe revelation that seemingly innocent social gatherings can harbor supernatural threats reinforces the campaign\u0026rsquo;s themes about hidden dangers in ordinary situations. The night hag\u0026rsquo;s familiarity with the party\u0026rsquo;s past adventures suggests their reputation is spreading across the multiverse, potentially attracting both allies and enemies.\nThe detective-themed rewards provide both mechanical benefits and roleplay opportunities, while the family drama adds emotional weight to what could have been a simple combat encounter. The session ends with the party having new magical items and renewed appreciation for thorough investigation before accepting mysterious invitations.\nCharacter Development Highlights # Olivia demonstrates her investigative expertise and leadership during crisis situations Red shows improved tactical thinking with his Spirit Guardians placement and ally support Bru continues his evolution from chaotic wildcard to effective team member with strategic thinking Helisanna balances her performer persona with combat effectiveness and magical investigation The entire party shows growing coordination in both social and combat encounters This interlude serves as both a satisfying standalone adventure and important character development, while advancing the broader campaign narrative through connections to previous encounters and hints at future threats.\n","date":"7 March 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-2/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party attends a birthday party that turns from game to deadly reality when a shapeshifting night hag is revealed as the true killer.","title":"Interlude II: Murder at the Manor","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Background: The Masquerade Challenge (Previous Session) # The Call for Help # About a month prior, the party was contacted in their dreams by Toonlock, a fae spirit whose realm is being ransacked by Crowley. Using the totem the party had given him months earlier, Crowley has gained direct access to Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s domain and is systematically destroying it. The party agreed to help by completing three challenges to restore balance to the realm.\nInitial Combat # The party\u0026rsquo;s arrival was met with immediate resistance - they fought off dodos and a walrus that were part of Crowley\u0026rsquo;s chaotic invasion before proceeding to the first challenge.\nThe Masquerade Challenge # The first trial took place at an elaborate fae masquerade ball, where the party needed to collect specific masks to complete a theatrical performance.\nThe Invisible Maitre d' # The party encountered an invisible maitre d\u0026rsquo; at the masquerade - they could see his formal attire (tuxedo, cufflinks, white mask) but not the figure himself. He proved to be quite rude, particularly toward one party member, creating what became an ongoing antagonistic relationship.\nFollowing the Guiding Light # The maitre d\u0026rsquo; provided a magical light that would lead them to the masks they needed. The light served as their guide throughout the various locations within the masquerade realm.\nThe Crying Spirits # Following sounds of distress, the party discovered:\nA child ghost crying under a table, searching for its mother and letting out painful screeches The mother spirit weeping in a nearby pond When reunited, both spirits embraced and disappeared into the water, leaving behind the Maiden Mask The Princess Mask Effect # Bru was chosen to wear the Maiden Mask, which compelled him to feel and act like a \u0026ldquo;pretty princess\u0026rdquo; for the remainder of the evening. While his appearance remained unchanged, his behavior and mindset were magically altered.\nThe Amphitheater Performance # The guiding light led the party to an abandoned amphitheater where Bru was spotlighted on stage. They discovered they needed to collect four additional masks to complete a theatrical performance, with specific roles assigned to each party member.\nThe Mask Collection Trials # The Fawn Mask - Dance Battle:\nA mask spotted in trees fled to the band area The party faced off against a group of fawn performers in an epic dance battle The crowd was won over, chanting \u0026ldquo;Taco Cat\u0026rdquo; (the party\u0026rsquo;s band name) Victory earned them the Fawn Mask The Devil Mask - Treasure Cave:\nA cave marked \u0026ldquo;Take What You Need\u0026rdquo; filled with gold and treasure Three masks on pedestals: black, red (pit fiend), and white The challenge required selecting the correct devil mask \u0026ldquo;wreathed in flame\u0026rdquo; Choosing the wrong mask (black) triggered a mimic attack All the gold in the cave was revealed to be mimics (earning the phrase \u0026ldquo;Oops, all mimics\u0026rdquo;) Silas was handcuffed to prevent theft, showing unusual restraint The Knight Mask - Pond Retrieval:\nA mask lay at the bottom of a pond Olivia volunteered to retrieve it, tied to a rope for safety The mask was guarded by an ooze creature The party successfully extracted Olivia and retreated rather than fight the ooze The Jester Mask - Musical Monkey:\nA field of flowers contained a monkey wearing a jester mask The creature constantly jumped around, frustrating the party Helisanna used her musical abilities to entrance the monkey While it danced to her music, they stole the mask without violence The Final Performance # Returning to the amphitheater with all five masks, the party performed assigned roles:\nRed: The Fool Bru: The Princess (Maiden) Olivia: The Knight Helisanna: The Devil Elspeth: The Fawn The performance was successful, with ghostly audience members joining the show. They were awarded their prize mask.\nThe Maitre d\u0026rsquo;s Parting Words # The invisible maitre d\u0026rsquo; made pointed comments about identity and transformation:\n\u0026ldquo;You can be anybody you want to be\u0026rdquo; References to \u0026ldquo;fall from grace\u0026rdquo; Implications about wanting to reclaim one\u0026rsquo;s true self These comments particularly stung one party member who felt they were being attacked for past events, and also resonated with Silas, whose identity constantly shifts as part of his nature.\nCurrent Session: The Convent Challenge # Pre-Session Preparation # The party takes a long rest in the astral tree village, where they\u0026rsquo;re celebrated as heroes for ending the nightly monster attacks. The grateful villagers, including the newly reunited couple Rowan and Isla, provide food and shelter. Red, Bru, and Elspeth receive heroic inspiration, feeling particularly pumped for the challenges ahead.\nThe Gothic Convent # Arriving through a portal, the party finds themselves on a bleak forest path leading to an imposing gothic structure. The convent is built from sepulchre black stone with a wrought iron fence, giving off a profoundly unwelcoming atmosphere. Torch-lit and clearly inhabited, the building looms ominously under a grotesque red moon in a starless sky.\nFirst Contact: The Gardening Nun # The party encounters their first vampire nun tending a garden of nightshade and orchids with an unnatural purplish hue. She hums off-key while watering the plants with blood from a watering can. When approached about the priest\u0026rsquo;s stole, she reveals her withered, corpse-like face and fangs, explaining that the stole is kept \u0026ldquo;under lock and key\u0026rdquo; and that they all have their needs - gesturing to her blood-soaked garden.\nCombat: The Vampire Nuns # Garden Battle # The initial confrontation erupts when the gardening nun reveals her true nature. The combat showcases effective teamwork:\nJasper leads the assault with his greatsword, using reckless attacks to great effect Olivia delivers devastating blows with her battle axe, using weapon mastery to knock enemies prone and following up with Divine Smite Silas strikes from stealth with precision psychic daggers Bru provides tactical support with his eldritch cannon\u0026rsquo;s protective mode, granting temporary hit points Elspeth coordinates attacks with BoxBox while using her magical gun Red attempts to maintain Spirit Guardians but loses concentration after taking damage The party successfully eliminates the nuns outside the convent, with additional vampire spawn joining the fray from various directions.\nThe Courtyard Investigation # Scaling the Walls # Olivia successfully climbs a 15-foot wall to scout the inner courtyard, discovering:\nA pedestal statue of a supplicant figure holding a silver key shaped like a heart A canopy of dead trees with blood-dripping purple leaves Angel statues covering their faces around the courtyard\u0026rsquo;s perimeter The rest of the party eventually joins her atop the wall, with various degrees of success in their climbing attempts.\nThe Angel Statues Threat # Bru\u0026rsquo;s exceptional perception reveals the true danger: the angel statues move when not being observed directly, positioning themselves to attack. These creatures prove to be weeping angel-like entities that strike with stone fists and attempt to grapple party members.\nThe Courtyard Battle # Angel Assault # The encounter with the angels becomes a test of tactical awareness and creative problem-solving:\nHelisanna successfully uses Tasha\u0026rsquo;s Hideous Laughter to make one vampire fall from the trees Red casts Spirit Guardians, creating protective Goliath warriors with tomahawks Elspeth and Olivia become grappled by stone hands, taking significant damage Bru discovers the angels\u0026rsquo; weakness to thunder damage, using Shatter spell to devastating effect Creative Solutions # The party demonstrates excellent problem-solving:\nRed uses his Large Form ability to break free from a stone grip, though taking damage in the process Bru\u0026rsquo;s insight about the Shatter spell\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness against stone creatures turns the tide Kevin (Bru\u0026rsquo;s minion) helps by maintaining line of sight on statues The group forms a defensive circle to maintain visual contact with all remaining angels Key Discoveries and Rewards # Items Acquired # Silver heart-shaped key from the courtyard pedestal Bloody purple orchid collected by Bru from the garden Stone angel hand choker fashioned from a destroyed statue for Helisanna Devil mask and various other accessories from previous challenges Tactical Lessons # The session demonstrates the party\u0026rsquo;s growing tactical sophistication, particularly their ability to:\nCoordinate complex positioning and sight-lines Adapt to enemies with unusual mechanics (observation-based movement) Use creative spell applications (Shatter vs. stone creatures) Maintain team cohesion under pressure Character Development # Combat Roles Solidifying # Jasper emerges as a reliable frontline damage dealer with his barbarian abilities Olivia proves devastatingly effective against undead with her paladin smites Bru shows tactical brilliance with his spell selection and environmental awareness Elspeth continues to be a versatile combatant with gun and BoxBox coordination Red serves as the team\u0026rsquo;s backbone with healing and support magic Silas maintains his role as the precision striker from stealth Team Dynamics # The session showcases excellent communication and mutual support, with party members covering for each other\u0026rsquo;s weaknesses and building on each other\u0026rsquo;s strengths.\nSession Conclusion # The party successfully navigates both vampire and angel threats to secure the mysterious key, presumably needed to access the priest\u0026rsquo;s stole within the convent proper. The session ends at a natural stopping point, with the party having cleared the courtyard and ready to proceed into the convent interior.\nOngoing Mysteries # The purpose of the heart-shaped silver key The location and nature of the priest\u0026rsquo;s stole What additional challenges await inside the convent This session effectively balanced horror elements with tactical combat, showcasing both the party\u0026rsquo;s growing capabilities and the creative challenges that Toonlock\u0026rsquo;s realm presents. The gothic vampire convent setting provided an atmospheric backdrop for memorable encounters that tested both combat skills and problem-solving abilities.\n","date":"28 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/interlude-1/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party infiltrates a vampire convent to retrieve a priest\u0026rsquo;s stole, battling undead nuns and terrifying angel statues.","title":"Interlude I: The Convent of Bloody Orchids","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Overview # The party finds themselves in a village at the base of an astral tree, where they quickly discover that all the villagers are trapped by mysterious circumstances. What begins as a series of simple community problems evolves into a fight for survival against monstrous abominations threatening the entire settlement.\nVillage Problem-Solving Speedrun # The party embarks on an impressive speedrun of village problems, helping multiple residents with their various difficulties:\nElder Bryn\u0026rsquo;s Driftwood Dilemma: The party assists Elder Bryn in collecting driftwood for his mystical rituals, though they\u0026rsquo;re amused to discover he\u0026rsquo;s been searching in trash cans instead of the obvious location - the beach.\nFinnick\u0026rsquo;s Fishing Solution: Bru provides a creative solution to Finnick\u0026rsquo;s fishing pole problem by giving him dynamite, leading to explosive fishing success and lots of laughter by the water.\nThe Love Triangle Resolution: The party plays matchmaker between Isla, a Goliath herbalist with unique absorbing eyes, and Rowan, an elven hunter who\u0026rsquo;s been at the village for about 100 years. They help gather supplies for gifts and encourage both parties to express their feelings.\nThe Theft Mystery: Using investigative skills, the party discovers that Juni (a young halfling artist) has been stealing tools from Thalos the blacksmith to create a friendship bracelet for Thomas, a 14-year-old human boy who\u0026rsquo;s been trapped in the village for about two years. They resolve the situation diplomatically, encouraging Juni to express her friendship through her artistic talents instead.\nTool Trading Chain: They successfully negotiate with Thalos to get carving tools for Rowan without him having to trade away his precious bow, creating a win-win situation for the budding romance.\nThe Dark Truth Revealed # The Cave Investigation # When young Thomas mentions strange sounds from a nearby cave, Silas investigates and discovers Sol waiting inside. Sol reveals the true nature of their situation: the villagers are trapped by monstrous creatures that attack every night, and the only way to escape is to defeat these abominations.\nThe Prophecy Vision # Elder Bryn performs a driftwood-burning ritual that creates mystical visions in the steam. The ceremony reveals two possible futures:\nFailure: Red is killed by the abominations, his blood opens a portal, and the monsters escape to terrorize other realms Success: Red defeats the monsters, lighting a portal that allows everyone to escape The Village\u0026rsquo;s History # Through conversations with villagers, the party learns disturbing details:\nMost villagers arrived by accident through various portals 50 years ago, two wizards used this location as an experimental base, creating monstrous hybrid creatures The wizards disappeared, but their creations became increasingly dangerous Every night, waves of mutant animals attack the village, forcing everyone to shelter The Night Battle # First Wave: Protecting the Village # As night falls, the monsters attack in force. The party faces:\nStar-feathered raptors: Eagle-ostrich hybrids that can fly and snatch people Wolf-raptors: Velociraptor-wolf combinations that leap between tree branches During this initial skirmish, Rowan is captured by one of the flying creatures, but the party successfully rescues him, though he\u0026rsquo;s injured. Isla tends to his wounds, strengthening their newfound relationship.\nSecond Wave: The Final Confrontation # The party pursues the monsters to a platform near the original portal location, where they face the primary abominations in an epic boss battle:\nThe Enemy Party:\nBoog: A massive rhinoceros-gorilla hybrid serving as the tank Klar: A praying mantis with a lion\u0026rsquo;s head, the party\u0026rsquo;s grappler Kemal/Seamall: A camel-zebra combination with acid spit attacks Excess: A scorpion-snake that can hypnotize opponents Sar: An owl with monstrous bat wings that can push enemies off the tree Combat Highlights # Silas delivers devastating sneak attacks, including an anime-style finishing move on Boog where he plunges a dagger between the creature\u0026rsquo;s eyes Helisana uses tactical Eldritch Blast with Repelling Blast to knock enemies off the tree branches Elspeth and BoxBox coordinate attacks with her gun and his force-empowered tools Red provides crucial healing support with mass healing word and his channel divinity abilities Bru contributes with his force ballista and explosive spells The battle becomes increasingly desperate as the monsters use diverse saving throw attacks (wisdom for fear, dexterity for area effects, constitution for sonic attacks, intelligence for psychic damage), testing every aspect of the party\u0026rsquo;s defenses.\nResolution and New Horizons # Victory and Escape # When the final abominations fall, their blood fills mystical glyphs carved into the tree platform, opening multiple portals around the area. The villagers are finally free to leave their astral tree prison, with some choosing to return home while others may seek new adventures.\nSol\u0026rsquo;s Revelation # Sol appears after the battle, revealing his role as the one who guided them to this trial. He suggests the party could benefit from more training before \u0026ldquo;saving the world,\u0026rdquo; hinting at greater challenges ahead. Multiple portals now offer opportunities for different adventures and training arcs.\nCharacter Development Moments # Rowan and Isla: Their relationship blossoms through the shared crisis, with both expressing their feelings through handmade gifts Juni and Thomas: A new friendship forms between the young artist and the homesick boy The Party: Successfully demonstrates their ability to both solve community problems and handle major threats Session Impact # This session serves as both a breather episode with heartwarming community problem-solving and a significant plot advancement revealing the broader cosmic threats the party faces. The multiple portals opening at the end provides a framework for future adventures and potential guest DM opportunities.\nThe successful completion of both the social challenges and combat encounters demonstrates the party\u0026rsquo;s growing effectiveness as a team, while Sol\u0026rsquo;s comments about needing more training before \u0026ldquo;saving the world\u0026rdquo; foreshadow larger conflicts ahead.\nNotable Quotes and Moments # Elder Bryn\u0026rsquo;s confession about looking for driftwood in trash cans instead of the beach The party\u0026rsquo;s exasperation with villagers who won\u0026rsquo;t solve their own obvious problems Silas\u0026rsquo;s anime-style finishing move on Boog with the dramatic one-liner The romantic development between Rowan and Isla through the crisis Sol\u0026rsquo;s mysterious presence and hints about greater challenges ahead This session effectively balances character development, community building, world exploration, and high-stakes combat, providing satisfaction for multiple types of D\u0026amp;D gameplay preferences while advancing the overarching narrative.\n","date":"28 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-21/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party helps trapped villagers with their daily problems while uncovering the dark truth behind their astral tree sanctuary.","title":"21: Trapped In Tree Land","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Session Recap and Preparation # The session began with an extensive recap of the previous episode\u0026rsquo;s events. The Taco Cat crew (Helisanna, Elspeth Cooper, Felonias Bru, Jasper Gaines, Detective Olivia Cooper, and Silas Fairbanks) had successfully completed a mission for the Twilight Company to investigate Johnny Travolta, who was selling out the organization. Their infiltration of his party led to Bru accidentally setting a butler\u0026rsquo;s coattails on fire, Silas pickpocketing a key, and the team acquiring evidence of Travolta\u0026rsquo;s betrayal.\nNotably, Elspeth had flirted with a guard during the mission - a human woman with red hair in a ponytail wearing a tuxedo. The party received 600 gold total and increased reputation with the Twilight Company for their successful mission.\nElspeth\u0026rsquo;s Date: Between missions, Elspeth went on an after-work date with the guard at the Common Mug. Despite the awkwardness (as all of Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s romantic encounters tend to be), she successfully obtained the woman\u0026rsquo;s phone number. The guard lives in Milstrom and appears to have an obnoxious neck tattoo and nose piercing, leading to jokes about her being a \u0026ldquo;working girl\u0026rdquo; who might take Elspeth to Slipknot concerts.\nJourney to the Wormhole # The party prepared for Red\u0026rsquo;s (Thurnock Skyhammer\u0026rsquo;s) trials by establishing psychic links between Silas, Olivia, Red, and Bru, while taking a long rest to restore their abilities. As they approached the cavern entrance, Red cast Thaumaturgy to announce their presence with a booming \u0026ldquo;Hello!\u0026rdquo; that echoed through the tunnels and caused ominous rumbling throughout the cave system.\nThe cave entrance was carved by a mythical beast, with glowing glyphs marking where its scales had rubbed against the walls. These runes provided dim lighting throughout the tunnel system, and both Red and Olivia could feel ancestral power vibrating through the air.\nThe Pressure Plate Puzzle # First Challenge: The party encountered their first trial - a series of five tiles with Goliath religious symbols arranged in a line across their path. Beyond the tiles lay a chasm that couldn\u0026rsquo;t be crossed without solving the puzzle.\nInitial Attempts: Red\u0026rsquo;s initial investigation revealed the symbols were Goliath religious iconography, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t decipher their meaning. When Olivia accidentally stepped on the third tile, it triggered a thunderous roar and a blast of force toward the ceiling. Bru\u0026rsquo;s superior perception (rolling a 20) revealed that the tiles increased in complexity from left to right, suggesting a sequence.\nTrial and Error: The party systematically tested each tile using Red\u0026rsquo;s quarterstaff and Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s Eldritch Blast. Red took significant damage (44 force damage) when he was caught too close to tile four\u0026rsquo;s activation. Through careful experimentation, they discovered that the tiles needed to be held down simultaneously in a specific order.\nSolution: After much deliberation and several painful mistakes, they realized the solution was elegantly simple - the tiles needed to be activated in numerical order: 1-2-3-4-5. When all five tiles were depressed simultaneously using rocks, a bridge of brilliant light formed across the chasm, allowing safe passage.\nThe Constellation Chamber # Second Challenge: The party entered a large circular chamber containing a perfect black void in the center - darker than anything they could imagine. Around this void, 28 tiles were etched into the stone floor, while the walls displayed four movable tiles marked with dot patterns.\nInvestigation: Silas\u0026rsquo;s keen insight (rolling 18) revealed that the wall tiles followed a pattern. An Arcana check confirmed these were constellation patterns, though they appeared to be incorrectly oriented or arranged. Olivia\u0026rsquo;s investigative expertise (rolling 16) determined that the tiles were shaped to fit together in a specific configuration, with certain pieces clearly being \u0026ldquo;end pieces.\u0026rdquo;\nSolution: Working as a team, the party rearranged and rotated the constellation tiles to form three recognizable star patterns:\nOrion the Hunter (the archer) Leo (the lion) Ursa Major (the great bear) When properly aligned, the constellations glowed with connecting lines of light, activating the chamber and revealing the massive presence that had been watching them.\nEncounter with Sol the Dragon # The Revelation: As the chamber activated, what the party had initially mistaken for architectural beams revealed themselves to be the coiled body of an enormous dragon. Sol emerged - a magnificent creature with scales that radiated starlight like shards of the night sky, creating a dappled, celestial glow.\nThe Test: Sol questioned why they had disturbed his slumber, leading to Red being pushed forward (literally) by his companions to face the trial. When Sol asked the riddle \u0026ldquo;What burns in your heart?\u0026rdquo;, Red answered honestly that his greatest desire was to protect and care for other people, preventing them from coming to harm.\nApproval: Sol approved of Red\u0026rsquo;s answer and revealed his role as a guardian of the trials. He explained that the black circle was a portal to the astral tree - a cosmic hub connecting many worlds across the universe. Despite the party\u0026rsquo;s concerns about being able to return, Sol assured them they could come back once Red proved himself worthy.\nJourney Through the Astral Tree # The Portal: Sol forced the entire party through the portal with a sweep of his tail. They emerged on a platform within a massive tree surrounded by a thick, star-speckled forest that seemed to blend swamp and cosmic void in a disorienting manner.\nSol\u0026rsquo;s Transformation: Sol reappeared in the form of an elderly, hunchbacked Goliath with a cane and raggedy clothes, though he maintained the same voice. When the party questioned this obvious shapeshifting, Sol played coy, insisting he was \u0026ldquo;a different person\u0026rdquo; named Sol, leading to Silas\u0026rsquo;s visible frustration.\nThe Ancestral Gift: Before beginning their descent, Sol presented Red with a tomahawk - a gift from his parents and part of his heritage as a Skyhammer. Red awkwardly accepted the weapon, admitting he had no experience with martial weapons.\nThe Endless Descent: The party spent literally all day walking down the spiral stairs within the massive tree. What began as an energetic jog quickly became an exhausting trudge as they realized the true scale of their descent.\nArrival at Lakeshore Vale # First Impressions: The party finally reached a lakeside village built on multiple tiers with wooden structures connected by boardwalks. The settlement appeared to be populated by beings from various worlds who had arrived through the astral tree\u0026rsquo;s portal network.\nCallum the Warforged: Their first encounter was with Callum, a somewhat rusty warforged guard who welcomed them to Lakeshore Vale while strictly prohibiting \u0026ldquo;roughhousing.\u0026rdquo; Despite claiming to have had a great day, Callum\u0026rsquo;s responses suggested he was easily irritated and had strong opinions about the village residents.\nVillage Gossip: Callum provided extensive gossip about the villagers:\nFinnick: A large fisherman who feeds much of the town Thalos: A blacksmith whom Callum considered \u0026ldquo;very rude\u0026rdquo; Rowan and Isla: Two residents caught in a mutual but unspoken romantic attraction Elder Bryn: An elderly village leader Meeting the Locals # Finnick the Fisherman: The party found Finnick, a tubby halfling, napping while fishing. He successfully caught a large tuna with his backup fishing rod, revealing that his prized fishing rod had been stolen approximately a month ago. He suspected Tanner of the theft but didn\u0026rsquo;t want to \u0026ldquo;cast blame\u0026rdquo; (a fishing pun that Bru appreciated). When agitated, Finnick developed a pronounced Chicago accent and became defensive about his livelihood.\nBru\u0026rsquo;s Explosive Innovation: In a moment that would have lasting consequences, Bru introduced Finnick to fishing with dynamite. The first explosive was \u0026ldquo;on the house,\u0026rdquo; but subsequent ones would cost five gold each. This led to multiple explosions in the lake and many dead fish floating to the surface.\nElder Bryn: The party found the supposed village leader digging through trash, searching for driftwood. Bryn explained that he performed \u0026ldquo;prophecy rituals\u0026rdquo; using driftwood that supposedly predicted who would arrive in the village next. He claimed these rituals had successfully predicted the arrival of Callum and Isla, though he admitted one time it predicted no one would come.\nThe Driftwood Debacle # The Quest: Elder Bryn desperately needed driftwood for his prophecy ritual, despite the fact that driftwood was readily available on the nearby beach. His inability to locate it himself suggested either incompetence or some other limitation.\nBru\u0026rsquo;s Stealth Mission: Using psychic communication with Silas, Bru stealthily retrieved driftwood from the beach while Finnick was distracted by his new explosive fishing techniques. However, confusion arose when Finnick warned against giving the driftwood to \u0026ldquo;Silas\u0026rdquo; (meaning Elder Bryn shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be given the driftwood), but Bru misunderstood this as Finnick opposing the elder.\nPower Dynamics: In a bizarre turn of events, Elder Bryn declared that by bringing him the driftwood, Bru had proven his trustworthiness and could now be considered the \u0026ldquo;elder\u0026rdquo; or even \u0026ldquo;ruler\u0026rdquo; of the village. This led to Bru jokingly ordering Bryn to fight Finnick to the death, much to Red and Silas\u0026rsquo;s horror.\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s Intervention: Growing increasingly frustrated with the circular conversations and apparent incompetence of the villagers, Olivia grabbed the driftwood from Elder Bryn and threw it back into the water, pointing out that it would simply drift back to shore naturally.\nBrewing Tensions and Mysteries # The Trial\u0026rsquo;s Purpose: Throughout these interactions, it became clear that Red\u0026rsquo;s trial involved helping the people of Lakeshore Vale, though the specific requirements remained unclear. The party began identifying several potential quests:\nRecovering Finnick\u0026rsquo;s stolen fishing rod from Tanner Resolving the unspoken romance between Rowan and Isla Dealing with Thomas, who supposedly won\u0026rsquo;t do her chores Managing Elder Bryn\u0026rsquo;s driftwood obsession Understanding Callum\u0026rsquo;s role as an unreliable narrator Village Dynamics: The party began to suspect that Callum, their initial source of information, might be providing inverted or false information about the other villagers. Thalos the \u0026ldquo;rude\u0026rdquo; blacksmith had actually been friendly when they passed, and many of Callum\u0026rsquo;s other assessments seemed questionable.\nExplosive Consequences: The session ended with yet another explosion echoing across the lake as Bru\u0026rsquo;s fishing innovations continued to reshape the local ecosystem, while Silas contemplated whether to stab Bru or himself to end the madness.\nKey Character Developments # Red/Thurnock: Demonstrated genuine heroic instincts in answering Sol\u0026rsquo;s riddle about what burns in his heart, showing his desire to protect others. However, he also showed concerning pragmatism in suggesting they could sacrifice BoxBox (Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s robot companion) for puzzle-solving.\nBru: Found his element in the chaotic village environment, quickly adapting to become \u0026ldquo;elder\u0026rdquo; and introducing destructive fishing techniques. His ability to navigate the village\u0026rsquo;s bizarre social dynamics suggested he might be more at home here than anywhere else.\nSilas: Grew increasingly frustrated with the circular conversations and apparent incompetence surrounding them, showing his preference for efficiency and logic over the village\u0026rsquo;s nonsensical approach to problem-solving.\nElspeth: Continued developing her romantic subplot with her new girlfriend while maintaining her practical approach to challenges.\nOlivia: Demonstrated her detective background by asking pointed questions and eventually taking direct action to resolve the driftwood situation when diplomatic approaches failed.\nHelisanna: Provided reliable magical support and combat capabilities while observing the unfolding chaos with characteristic detachment.\nSession Themes and Implications # This session showcased the classic D\u0026amp;D theme of heroes being pulled into local problems that seem trivial but reveal deeper community dynamics. The village of Lakeshore Vale appears to be a testing ground where Red must demonstrate leadership and problem-solving skills, though whether the villagers\u0026rsquo; problems are genuine or manufactured for the trial remains unclear.\nThe introduction of explosive fishing techniques, romantic subplots, missing property, and village politics suggests the party will need to balance multiple ongoing quests while navigating a community where reliable information is scarce and everyone seems to have their own agenda.\nThe session ended on a cliffhanger with continuing explosions and mounting frustration, setting up future sessions focused on resolving the village\u0026rsquo;s numerous interconnected problems while uncovering the true nature of Red\u0026rsquo;s trials.\n","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-20/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The Taco Cat crew ventures into the mysterious wormhole for Red\u0026rsquo;s Skyhammer trials, solving ancient puzzles and meeting a star-touched dragon before descending into the chaotic village of Lakeshore Vale.","title":"20: Trials of the W****M Hole","type":"sessions"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/groups/","section":"Groups","summary":"","title":"Groups","type":"groups"},{"content":" Lakeshore Vale Villagers # Settlement Overview # Lakeshore Vale is a village built on multiple tiers with wooden structures connected by boardwalks, located at the base of a massive astral tree.

However, their peaceful celebration is disrupted when an evil doppelganger of Caspian (the Winter King\u0026rsquo;s assistant) appears and corrupts the solstice magic, forcing the party into a series of battles to save the celebration.\nOpening: Solstice Festivities # The session opens with the village of Milstrom in full winter solstice celebration mode. The town square features:\nAn ice skating rink in the center A snowman building contest in a nearby field Carolers performing throughout the village A massive decorated Yule tree in the beer garden Various festive decorations and gatherings Party Activities # Silas and Bru operate a sketchy ice skate rental business, stealing townspeople\u0026rsquo;s skates and relabeling them with their own branding Red joins the snowman building contest with local children Billy, Jimmy, and Timmy, using his height advantage to build massive snowballs Elspeth sets up a tinkering booth making sleds and ball-throwing devices for free (much to Silas\u0026rsquo;s dismay) Helisanna explores the beer garden and festivities Olivia observes the celebration Introduction of Jasper Gaines # A new character enters the scene: Jasper Gaines, a human barbarian wearing Eldoran armor with dull crystal embellishments. He arrives leading a wagon full of beer casks for the tavern, demonstrating his connection to the local community through his friendship with Roscoe.\nThe Corrupted Solstice Attack # The Winter Storm # A sudden, unnatural winter storm descends upon the town, filled with pellets of snow and strange crystal dust that obscures everyone\u0026rsquo;s vision. When the storm clears, the entire celebration has been corrupted:\nChildren\u0026rsquo;s toys have been replaced with \u0026ldquo;werewolf erotica\u0026rdquo; Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s precious alcohol has been replaced with \u0026ldquo;bangers and mash\u0026rdquo; A child\u0026rsquo;s insulin has been replaced with a crystal figurine Various other gifts and celebration items have been corrupted The Impostor Revealed # From atop the church, a scantily clad water genasi in a bikini (despite the winter weather) reveals herself as \u0026ldquo;Caspian\u0026rdquo;. However, Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s religion knowledge (rolling an 18) reveals this is likely an impostor, as the real Caspian is known to be fully clothed and complains about magical image distortions.\nThe impostor declares: \u0026ldquo;Listen up, you wankers! I\u0026rsquo;ve turned evil now. I am Caspian Shores. I need to ruin your solstice.\u0026rdquo;\nInitial Combat # Jasper immediately attacks the impostor (dubbed \u0026ldquo;Negacast\u0026rdquo;) with his hand axes, dealing significant damage. The impostor retaliates by creating snow fists that attack Jasper, then disappears while promising more chaos.\nThree Crisis Points # The party must split their attention to handle three simultaneous magical attacks across the village:\nCrisis 1: The Corrupted Yule Tree # Location: Beer garden behind the pub\nThe massive 30-foot Yule tree becomes bewitched, with its decorative ribbons transforming into deadly tendrils that pierce villagers and transform them into Christmas ornaments that get pulled onto the tree.\nCombat Highlights:\nHelisanna uses Misty Step to get to high ground and attacks with Eldritch Blast Olivia charges in with her battle axe, dealing massive damage with critical hits and Divine Smite Jasper follows up with devastating greatsword attacks using his berserker rage The party discovers a corrupted crystal tree topper that\u0026rsquo;s controlling the magic Helisanna destroys the crystal with psychic damage Eldritch Blasts, breaking the enchantment Resolution: The tree is toppled and the crystal destroyed, freeing all the ornament-people and returning them to normal.\nCrisis 2: The Snowman Army # Location: The snowman contest field\nAll the snowmen built for the contest come to life and begin attacking the children who built them. The party discovers that destroying individual snowmen only causes their snow to flow back to the giant snowman Red had built with the children.\nCombat Highlights:\nOlivia lights her battle axe on fire using lamp oil to combat the snow creatures Jasper performs an incredible flaming sword strike, sliding on the ice and lighting his blade mid-attack with bardic inspiration The party realizes they need to destroy the controlling crystal rather than the snowmen themselves Olivia delivers the killing blow to the crystal with Divine Smite Resolution: All snowmen return to normal snow once their controlling crystal is destroyed.\nCrisis 3: The Corrupted Carolers # Location: The carolers\u0026rsquo; stage\nThe carolers become possessed with milky white eyes and begin singing Norwegian death metal that mind-controls anyone who listens. Those affected begin joining the horrible song against their will.\nCombat Highlights:\nOnly Jasper (rolling a 21 perception) spots the controlling crystal above the stage Jasper charges through the mind-control effect with a successful charisma save Olivia summons her fey ram Bob and uses Fey Step to teleport directly to the action The party coordinates attacks while resisting the mind-control effects Multiple party members fall under the song\u0026rsquo;s influence and attack their allies The crystal is eventually destroyed, freeing all the carolers Resolution: The horrible music stops and the carolers return to normal holiday songs.\nFinal Confrontation: Negacast # The Ice Rink Battle # The party converges on the ice skating rink for the final confrontation with Negacast, who is revealed to be floating above the center of the rink.\nKey Combat Elements:\nThe ice rink becomes a battlefield with treacherous frozen terrain Negacast uses ice-based magic to restrain and attack the party Olivia lands a devastating critical hit with Divine Smite (40 damage total) Jasper deals consistent damage with his berserker rage Elspeth provides ranged support while BoxBox engages in melee The Protective Tattoos # During combat, the party notices strange tattoos on Negacast\u0026rsquo;s abdomen. Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s arcana check (17) identifies these as sigils of warding designed to keep out outside observation and presence.\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Crucial Role: Red successfully uses Dispel Magic to remove the protective tattoos, rolling exactly the DC needed (15) after using inspiration to reroll.\nThe Real Caspian\u0026rsquo;s Arrival # Once the protective wards are dispelled:\nGentle snowfall begins to replace the harsh storm All of Negacast\u0026rsquo;s corruptions across the town begin reversing automatically The real Caspian appears, wearing proper Winter King assistant attire (blue suit with crystal studs, appropriate for the weather) Caspian traps Negacast in a crystal prison for the party to deliver finishing blows Team Finishing Move # The party coordinates a spectacular team attack:\nHelisanna blasts Jasper with Eldritch Blast to propel him forward Jasper and Olivia perform simultaneous cross-decapitation strikes The attack reveals Negacast wasn\u0026rsquo;t actually Caspian but some kind of construct or summoned being Negacast dissolves into snow and ash, with a screaming skull at its core that also disintegrates Resolution and Aftermath # Caspian\u0026rsquo;s Gratitude # The real Caspian thanks the party and:\nHeals all the injured villagers Completely reverses all the corruption (booze returns, proper gifts restored, etc.) Gives each party member beautiful crystal figurines as rewards Gives Elspeth an autographed copy of her favorite Caspian novel Helps restore the celebration atmosphere Gift Exchange Tradition # The party participates in a \u0026ldquo;White Owlbear\u0026rdquo; gift exchange (their world\u0026rsquo;s version of White Elephant):\nGifts Exchanged:\nHelisanna receives: Silas\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;one crime carried out on your behalf\u0026rdquo; coupon Jasper receives: Olivia\u0026rsquo;s detective magnifying glass Elspeth receives: VIP tickets for 10 to \u0026ldquo;Gaines Brewery Bakery and Bankery\u0026rdquo; in Eldora Olivia receives: Helisanna\u0026rsquo;s bottle of Emmervale Elixir from High Forge Red receives: Elspeth\u0026rsquo;s custom train track with mini Vroomfall and Doomfall cars Silas and Bru\u0026rsquo;s exchange: Deferred to next session Celebration Continues # Despite the interruptions, the village successfully continues their winter solstice celebration with:\nThe Yule tree restored to its upright position Children healed and gifts returned Community spirit restored A general atmosphere of warmth and celebration Cliffhanger: Crowley\u0026rsquo;s Return # As Caspian prepares to leave town using the Winter King\u0026rsquo;s magic to travel on the north wind, she finds herself trapped in an eerie void with no stars or ambient sound.\nCrowley\u0026rsquo;s Appearance: The fae entity Crowley appears in a caroler\u0026rsquo;s outfit (top hat and puffy jacket), singing a menacing version of \u0026ldquo;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u0026rdquo; with threatening lyrics. He greets Caspian as an \u0026ldquo;old friend,\u0026rdquo; revealing their prior history, and the scene cuts to black after he blows out his candle.\nImplications: This suggests Crowley has larger plans involving multiple powerful beings and may have been behind the Negacast attack as part of a broader scheme.\nCharacter Development # Jasper Gaines Integration # Successfully proved his worth to the party through consistent combat effectiveness Demonstrated connection to local community (friendship with Roscoe) Showed tactical thinking and berserker combat prowess Improved Eldoran reputation in the village through heroic actions Party Dynamics # Excellent teamwork displayed across multiple simultaneous combat encounters Creative problem-solving with environmental obstacles (ice, fire, crystals) Strong coordination in the final team attack sequence Growing acceptance of Jasper as a temporary or permanent party member Red\u0026rsquo;s Growth # Successfully used Dispel Magic at a crucial moment Showed improved tactical awareness in identifying magical threats Continued role as primary healer and support character Genuine joy in receiving the toy train set gift Combat and Mechanical Highlights # New 2024 D\u0026amp;D Rules in Action # Jasper\u0026rsquo;s barbarian abilities showcased the improved skill system (using Strength for Perception) Mount combat mechanics with Olivia and Bob the ram Creative use of environmental factors (fire, ice, crystals) Effective use of bardic inspiration and team coordination Tactical Elements # Multi-front combat requiring party coordination Environmental puzzle-solving (identifying crystals as weak points) Creative weapon enhancement (lighting axes on fire) Effective use of positioning and battlefield control Ongoing Plot Threads # Crowley\u0026rsquo;s Master Plan: The fae entity appears to be targeting powerful magical beings systematically Eldoran Relations: Jasper\u0026rsquo;s presence and heroics improve relations between Milstrom and Eldora Gaines Brewery Mystery: The tickets suggest potential future adventures in Eldora Caspian\u0026rsquo;s Fate: Her capture by Crowley may require future rescue efforts Party Composition: Jasper\u0026rsquo;s potential permanent addition to the group Session Themes # This session expertly balanced holiday festivities with serious threats, showcasing:\nCommunity Spirit: The importance of protecting celebration and tradition Teamwork: Multiple simultaneous threats requiring coordination Good vs. Corruption: The contrast between genuine celebration and twisted imitations New Alliances: Jasper\u0026rsquo;s integration and improved Eldoran relations Growing Threats: Crowley\u0026rsquo;s expanding influence and mysterious master plan The winter solstice setting provided an excellent backdrop for both heartwarming community moments and dramatic magical combat, while the cliffhanger ending sets up significant future plot developments involving Crowley\u0026rsquo;s schemes.\n","date":"21 December 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-18/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party returns to Milstrom for winter solstice festivities, only to face an evil doppelganger threatening their celebration.","title":"Winter Solstice Special","type":"sessions"},{"content":" The Moon\u0026rsquo;s Destruction # The session opens with the catastrophic destruction of the real moon by Eldora\u0026rsquo;s artificial satellite. The party witnesses Luminar, the moon goddess, falling to earth as a brilliant streak of light after her celestial body explodes. The impact creates massive shockwaves and a golden glow on the eastern horizon, fundamentally altering the cosmic balance.\nThe party realizes this represents Eldora\u0026rsquo;s systematic campaign to eliminate rival gods from the pantheon, making herself the sole divine power. Red becomes particularly concerned about Tyr\u0026rsquo;s safety, fearing he may lose his divine powers if his god is killed.\nQuestioning Father Jacob # After the cranky Father Jacob finally finishes his morning coffee, the party extracts crucial information about Red\u0026rsquo;s origins:\nThe Skyhammer Massacre: When Red was an infant, Eldoran Knights attacked his village, killing most warriors and taking the scientists and technological knowledge The Skyhammer Program: Red\u0026rsquo;s clan has been working on building starships to reach space and potentially destroy Eldora\u0026rsquo;s fake moon Red\u0026rsquo;s Importance: His bloodline is somehow essential to powering their spacecraft, though the exact mechanism remains mysterious The Rescue: The Crosses (Red\u0026rsquo;s adoptive parents) were Tyr followers who helped hide Red from the Eldoran forces Consulting the Prophecy Sheep # Olivia and Elspeth hike to consult the reborn oracle sheep, learning disturbing prophecies:\nMore gods will die in the coming conflict Jeremy (the shepherd) will die prematurely if they don\u0026rsquo;t intervene to save the world The moon goddess could potentially be revived, but it would require asking another god for help The sheep mentions a mysterious figure called \u0026ldquo;Tony\u0026rdquo; - possibly a mechanical or builder god Meanwhile, Bru attempts unsuccessfully to recruit the prophetic sheep for his \u0026ldquo;army.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Journey to the Skyhammers # The party begins their ascent up Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s Spine mountain, with George providing enthusiastic (if verbose) exposition about Project Purple Patch and his research into the Goliath clans. The two-and-a-half-day journey tests their mountaineering skills, but their magical cold-resistant cloaks and Bob the goat help them navigate the treacherous terrain.\nDuring evening camps, the party engages in character development:\nRed performs augury rituals, receiving divine confirmation they\u0026rsquo;re on the right path Silas begins teaching George lockpicking and other \u0026ldquo;Twilight Company skills\u0026rdquo; Olivia has stern conversations with George about the moral implications of criminal associations Discovering the Skyhammer Village # Upon reaching the mountain\u0026rsquo;s summit, the party encounters Goliath sentries and is escorted into a remarkable settlement:\nVillage Features # Advanced Technology: Solar panels, electric lights, aluminum and steel construction The Rocket Platform: A massive partially-constructed spacecraft dominates the village center Solarpunk Aesthetic: Technology integrated harmoniously with the mountain environment Crystal-Powered Equipment: White crystal technology similar to but distinct from Eldoran violessence crystals Defensive Preparations: Guards equipped with railguns and crystal-embedded weapons Meeting Elder Ragar # The party is brought before Ragar, an ancient Goliath elder who serves as the clan\u0026rsquo;s leader. During their formal meeting:\nRed\u0026rsquo;s Recognition # Red\u0026rsquo;s tattoo style matches the clan\u0026rsquo;s artistic traditions His knowledge of his birth name (Thurnok Skyhammer) helps establish his identity The revelation of Marion and Robert Cross\u0026rsquo;s murder saddens the clan, as they had lost contact The Bloodline Mystery # Only someone of the Skyhammer bloodline can power their spacecraft The knowledge of how this works was lost when Red\u0026rsquo;s birth parents died The clan believes the trials will either unlock this knowledge or kill Red in the attempt The Trials Ahead # Ragar explains that Red must enter the \u0026ldquo;Worms Tunnel\u0026rdquo; - a mystical passage carved by an ancient serpent that created reality-warping trials. Only the main Skyhammer bloodline can survive these tests, which are necessary to prove Red\u0026rsquo;s heritage and unlock the secrets of powering their starship.\nParty Dynamics and Rewards # Silas immediately begins negotiating for rewards, delighting when Ragar indicates they will indeed compensate the party for returning their lost prince. This represents a rare instance of the party receiving recognition for their heroic efforts.\nGeorge enthusiasts himself by planning to catalog valuable technologies while the others undergo trials, much to Silas\u0026rsquo;s approval and Olivia\u0026rsquo;s moral concern.\nThe Approach to Trials # The session concludes as Ragar leads the party to an enormous circular cave entrance marked with runic symbols and buffeted by mysterious winds.

Having defeated the Lacuna and the demon that was helping her, the party takes a much-needed short rest to recover from their injuries. The temple\u0026rsquo;s protective wards have been restored, but their efforts have revealed a new challenge: a crackling portal has appeared beside the temple, showing shadows moving on the other side.\nDuring the short rest:\nHelisanna provides bardic inspiration through her musical performance, with purple mist emanating from her axe toward party members Red uses Balm of Peace to heal the most injured party members Silas investigates the temple structure, discovering it was designed to create planar stability in the region The Shadowfell Portal Discovery # As the party recovers, they hear a familiar voice calling from beyond the crackling rift.

Can you hear me? We\u0026rsquo;re trapped. The shadows twist and pulse around the rips.\u0026rdquo;\nRed\u0026rsquo;s religion check (natural 20, total 25) reveals this is a rift to the Shadowfell - a bleak realm of perpetual twilight where emotions are dulled and hope is scarce. Prolonged exposure drains creatures of vitality and will to live. The pilgrims appear to be flickering between states, caught between realms.\nFather Jacob warns that \u0026ldquo;the rift must be closed, else Shadowfell will be open to our world.\u0026rdquo;\nOlivia\u0026rsquo;s Impulsive Decision # Without hesitation or consultation with her party, Olivia immediately responds to seeing George trapped.

They recruited several of Jeffrey\u0026rsquo;s lambs, which are now following Bru around as he attempts to train them in military formations. The party has received magical Woolen Cloaks of the Mountain Guardians from Jeffrey - these self-resizing magical cloaks provide resistance to cold damage both environmental and in combat.\nThe party is now pursuing George (Olivia\u0026rsquo;s grandson) and a group of Tyr pilgrims up Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s Spine, following the trail of Project Purple Patch - a Twilight Company investigation into supernatural disturbances in the mountain region.\nThe Ascent of Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s Spine # As the party climbs higher up the mountain following an established stone pathway marked with Tyr iconography, the environment becomes increasingly harsh and ominous:\nEnvironmental Changes: The landscape grows more jagged, temperatures drop significantly, and shadows extend unnaturally far beyond where sunlight should reach Supernatural Activity: The party encounters translucent figures of religious pilgrims in Tyr vestments who appear to be caught in mid-conversation, discussing \u0026ldquo;the breach,\u0026rdquo; efforts to \u0026ldquo;close the breach,\u0026rdquo; and their failure Psychological Effects: Party members begin experiencing an oppressive feeling of being watched, with movement glimpsed in peripheral vision that disappears when looked at directly Perception Check Results: Silas and Red are able to make out details of the ghostly pilgrims and catch fragments of their conversations about a failed mission to seal some kind of breach.\nDiscovery of the Abandoned Campsite # The party discovers a cold campsite in a clearing containing:\nPhysical Evidence # Three large tents capable of housing 3-4 people each Cold fire pit with frozen water bucket Winter camping supplies including dehydrated meals and frozen bread Religious vestments and Tyr scripture, particularly early dwarven Tyr stories Father Jacob\u0026rsquo;s Journal # Helisanna discovers and reads aloud a journal entry from Father Jacob, dated the 3rd moon of October (about a week prior):\n\u0026ldquo;By Tyr\u0026rsquo;s guiding hand, we have reached the shrine on Grimvar\u0026rsquo;s spine. The Ascendants tested our resolve, yet we remain steadfast in our mission. The breach must be sealed, for the rift to the Shadowfell grows ever more unstable. Its malevolence seeps into our world, corrupting all it touches. We go through the divine words as instructed, but something is amiss. The shadows move as though alive, whispering to us, mocking our efforts. I sense a presence here, ancient and insidious, feeding on the despair of this place. The others feel it too. Our strength wanes not from the climb but from the oppressive weight in the air.\u0026rdquo;\nThe journal continues, describing how they discovered remnants of previous failed attempts and mentions George having visions of \u0026ldquo;dark twisted figures on the other side of the rift waiting to pull us through.\u0026rdquo;\nGeorge\u0026rsquo;s Personal Effects # Olivia searches for and finds George\u0026rsquo;s belongings, including his journal which reveals:\nHe had caught up with the Tyr pilgrims as part of Project Purple Patch The mission involves closing a rift from which demons are emerging from the Shadow Realm There are mentions of \u0026ldquo;the chosen one\u0026rdquo; who was \u0026ldquo;lost amongst the giants and Goliaths in the mountains\u0026rdquo; Plans to continue investigating mountain clans after sealing the rift Silas\u0026rsquo;s Secret Discovery # While the others are distracted, Silas successfully steals a valuable silver necklace with amethyst crystals - traditional Tyr priest jewelry with large interconnected hoops, each containing an amethyst.\nAdditional Supplies Found # Red discovers one potion of minor healing About 1 gold and 10 silver scattered among the belongings Approaching the Corrupted Shrine # Following the stone pathway marked with Tyr\u0026rsquo;s scales iconography, the party reaches flattened plateau areas leading to a shrine structure.

The statue represents a woman who fetched water daily regardless of circumstances - normally depicted as confident and forward-looking, but now corrupted to appear grief-stricken.\nCombat: The Battle for the Shrine # Initiative and Combatants # Enemies: Lacuna: A corrupted, teleporting statue that causes despair and can phase between realities A demon that manifests when the party begins dispelling corruption Party Initiative: Helisanna (22), Bru (14), Olivia (11), Silas (10), Red (9), Elspeth (5) Round-by-Round Combat Summary # Round 1:\nHelisanna: Casts Mirror Image for protection and gives Red bardic inspiration Bru: Creates and places his Eldritch Cannon (flamethrower variant) on Olivia\u0026rsquo;s shoulder Lacuna: Teleports closer and hits most of the party with a despair effect (DC 20 Wisdom save) - only Red succeeds, causing all others to have attacks made against them with advantage for one minute Olivia: Charges in with her battleaxe, using Sacred Weapon and Divine Smite for massive radiant damage (22 total), attempts to topple the statue but it\u0026rsquo;s immune Silas: Successfully repairs one of the corrupted ward pillars using religion checks, causing silver chains to glow and begin restraining the statue Red: Uses Dispel Magic to cleanse corruption from a second pillar, further weakening Lacuna\u0026rsquo;s defenses Round 2:\nElspeth: Flanks with Olivia, using Green Flame Blade and her crossbow for solid damage Helisanna: Dominates with Eldritch Blast, dealing 50 damage in a single turn through critical hits and Hex Demon Manifestation: When Red dispels the second pillar, a demon appears demanding \u0026ldquo;What are you doing to my temple?\u0026rdquo; Lacuna: Teleports to Elspeth and deals massive damage (29 psychic), nearly killing her Round 3-4:\nOlivia: Uses Lay on Hands to heal Elspeth multiple times, keeping her alive through the fight Bru: Activates his cannon for area damage and casts Firebolt Silas: Works on the third pillar while the others hold the line Red: Heals the party with Balm of Peace and summons a Spiritual Weapon Lacuna: Continues teleporting and dealing heavy damage, knocking out both Olivia and Elspeth at different points Final Round:\nHelisanna: Successfully dispels the final pillar corruption, causing the demon to dissipate and weakening Lacuna significantly Restored Wards: With all pillars cleansed, Lacuna becomes fully corporeal and loses her damage resistances Bru: Deals significant thunder damage with Shatter (21 damage) Silas: Delivers the killing blow with a critical sneak attack for 31 damage, using his psychic powers to target the creature\u0026rsquo;s life force core Combat Resolution # As Lacuna dies, she appears relieved to be freed from her corrupted existence.

The portal collapses after a final desperate attempt by devils to break through, with a spectral clawed hand trying to drag itself into the world. Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s magic prevails, cleansing the shrine and restoring it to its natural state as gentle rain begins to fall and flowers bloom where corruption once festered.\nEleanor presents the Portal-Closing Amulet to Red, explaining it can be used to close other infernal rifts they might encounter in their travels.\nFrankie\u0026rsquo;s Transformation Decision # The party engages in an extensive discussion about Frankie the werewolf\u0026rsquo;s future. Eleanor offers three options:\nFull healing - Complete removal of lycanthropy Controlled lycanthropy - Maintain werewolf abilities with control, but risk becoming an uncontrollable beast during rare celestial alignments (twice yearly) Status quo - Remain as currently affected The decision is complicated by the presence of the artificial Eldoran moon, which forces Frankie to transform every night rather than just during full moons. After much deliberation and discussion about celestial alignments and potential solutions (including jokes about \u0026ldquo;blowing up the moon\u0026rdquo;), the party unanimously chooses full healing. Eleanor successfully performs the ritual, restoring Frankie to human form.\nPolitical Aftermath in Milstrom # Returning to town, the party encounters a town meeting at the Common Mug. The citizens are debating their future governance after the mayor\u0026rsquo;s death:\nWillamay advocates for a democratic council elected by the people Boone Rockwell suggests expanding the existing council structure rather than complete change Maggie and Big O support whatever keeps the community strong When asked for their input, the party\u0026rsquo;s suggestions range from single leadership (Silas) to representation and accountability (Olivia) to completely unconventional ideas (Goblin Law from Bru). Ultimately, they recommend taking time to consider all options rather than making hasty decisions, leading the town to postpone the decision for a month.\nThe Magnolia Investigation # Following up on Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s tip about Red\u0026rsquo;s parents\u0026rsquo; murder, the party visits Magnolia, an elderly halfling woman who lives in a cottage filled with quilted furniture. During their visit over tea (which contains mild hallucinogenic herbs), Magnolia reveals crucial information:\nShe witnessed Zeke leaving Red\u0026rsquo;s parents\u0026rsquo; house on the night they died She overheard an argument between Zeke and Red\u0026rsquo;s parents After Zeke left, she heard Red\u0026rsquo;s parents discussing how \u0026ldquo;Zeke knows too much\u0026rdquo; and that \u0026ldquo;maybe they will take care of him\u0026rdquo; She then heard sounds of violence and believes it was a murder-suicide triggered by whatever Zeke told them Important Note: Magnolia\u0026rsquo;s reliability as a witness is questionable due to her regular consumption of mildly psychoactive tea that affects memory.\nBreaking into Zeke\u0026rsquo;s Cottage # The party locates Zeke\u0026rsquo;s cottage in the woods, finding it apparently empty but with a fire still burning. Silas successfully picks the lock after disarming a needle trap, but the group\u0026rsquo;s investigation leads to disaster:\nKey Discoveries:\nZeke\u0026rsquo;s Journal: Reveals he is a spy for the Eldoran Empire Murder Revelation: Zeke deliberately poisoned the well water at Red\u0026rsquo;s family home, making their deaths appear like illness rather than murder Surveillance: Zeke has been monitoring Red and tracking Goliath movements in the mountains Escape Plans: Recent entries suggest Zeke was preparing to leave town The Fire Disaster: While investigating, the party accidentally causes a grease fire when trying to extinguish Zeke\u0026rsquo;s cooking pot. Their attempts to put it out with water only make it worse, and the cottage burns down completely. Fortunately, they escape with Zeke\u0026rsquo;s journal and a bag of the same herbs Magnolia uses in her tea.\nThe Chase and Escape # Using survival skills enhanced by psychic abilities, Silas tracks Zeke\u0026rsquo;s trail from the burned cottage to the Gold Road, where they discover:\nZeke rendezvoused with horses and riders Purple wisps (possibly magical tracking traces) lead toward the horizon He has too much of a head start to catch on foot The party realizes Zeke is likely heading to Eldora, putting their investigation on hold until they can follow.\nNegotiating the Caravan Delay # Before departing on the Pilgrim\u0026rsquo;s Path to search for Olivia\u0026rsquo;s grandson George, the party needs to handle their contract with Tien\u0026rsquo;s tiefling trading caravan. Helisana attempts to negotiate having them wait, but despite having advantage from party assistance, rolls poorly and ends up agreeing to pay 200 gold for the traders to wait in Milstrom during their detour.\nSetting Out on the Pilgrim\u0026rsquo;s Path # The session concludes with the party beginning their journey on the Pilgrim\u0026rsquo;s Path with Roscoe as their guide. The landscape shifts from vibrant colors to muted grays as they climb into the mountains, following ancient stones marked with the balanced scales of Tyr.\nThey make camp for the evening and spot a shepherd\u0026rsquo;s cottage with smoke rising from its chimney, setting up the next leg of their adventure.\nCharacter Development \u0026amp; Relationships # Red processes the devastating revelation about his parents\u0026rsquo; murder and the identity of their killer Olivia demonstrates leadership in political discussions and shows crafting skills by making gifts Silas proves invaluable with his investigative and stealth abilities, though his greed continues to be a defining trait Helisana struggles with substance use throughout the session, affecting her social interactions Bru maintains his explosive enthusiasm while being \u0026ldquo;managed\u0026rdquo; by the more responsible party members Elspeth serves as a voice of reason and technical expertise Loot \u0026amp; Items Acquired # Portal-Closing Amulet (given to Red by Eleanor) Demon Finger (trophy from the portal battle) Quilted Blankets (gifts from Magnolia) Zeke\u0026rsquo;s Journal (crucial evidence of the murder and espionage) Hallucinogenic Herbs (Zeke\u0026rsquo;s stash) Ongoing Plot Threads # Zeke\u0026rsquo;s Escape: The murderer of Red\u0026rsquo;s parents has fled toward Eldora George\u0026rsquo;s Search: Following the Pilgrim\u0026rsquo;s Path to find Olivia\u0026rsquo;s grandson The Artificial Moon: Ongoing concerns about the Eldoran Empire\u0026rsquo;s fake moon Caravan Contract: 200 gold expense and time pressure to complete the pilgrimage Portal Network: The amulet suggests more infernal rifts may need closing Milstrom\u0026rsquo;s Government: The town\u0026rsquo;s political future remains undecided Session Themes # This session expertly balanced investigation, character development, and world-building while advancing multiple plot threads. The accidental destruction of evidence added tension and consequences to the party\u0026rsquo;s actions, while the revelation about Red\u0026rsquo;s parents provided crucial backstory development. The session maintained the campaign\u0026rsquo;s blend of serious moments and comedic interactions, particularly around party dynamics and substance use.\nThe title \u0026ldquo;Burning Down the House\u0026rdquo; perfectly captures both the literal house fire and the metaphorical burning down of Red\u0026rsquo;s understanding of his family\u0026rsquo;s fate, making this a memorable and impactful session in the campaign\u0026rsquo;s narrative arc.\n","date":"11 November 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-13/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party closes the portal, decides Frankie\u0026rsquo;s fate, and investigates Red\u0026rsquo;s family history with explosive consequences.","title":"13: Burning down the house","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Into the Dark Woods # The session begins as the party prepares to pursue the Alpha Wolf that has just dragged Magnolia Redguard into the forest. Red activates his Large Form ability, growing to 12 feet tall, and immediately darts into the woods after the wolves, driven by determination to rescue Magnolia despite having no particular attachment to her.\nUsing his survival skills in the darkness, Red manages to pick up a blood trail despite the challenging conditions. The trail shows broken branches and blood splatters leading deeper into the woods, though the pace makes it difficult to catch up quickly.\nThe Pack Gathers # The rest of the party quickly mobilizes to follow Red\u0026rsquo;s pursuit:\nSilas Fairbanks takes a moment to be healed by Retired Detective Olivia Cooper before rushing after Red Felonias Bru and Silas ride on the back of Olivia\u0026rsquo;s summoned goat for speed Elspeth Cooper and Helisanna follow on foot, with Elspeth considering riding her steel defender BoxBox Red casts a light cantrip above himself, creating a beacon for the others to follow The party converges as they track the wolves deeper into the forest, with the goat-mounted riders able to keep pace with Red\u0026rsquo;s enhanced speed.\nWolf Negotiations # Upon reaching a clearing, the party discovers three wolves surrounding what appears to be Magnolia\u0026rsquo;s badly injured body. The confrontation quickly becomes complex when Helisanna casts Command on the alpha wolf, forcing it to approach. This reveals that the wolf can walk on two legs and shows clear signs of intelligence.\nSilas attempts to communicate with the wolves and realizes through an insight check that they possess unusual intelligence. Using his Psychic Phone telepathic connection, he establishes communication with the alpha wolf, who reveals himself to be Frankie - a werewolf who transforms between human and wolf form.\nAn Unlikely Alliance # Through Silas\u0026rsquo;s telepathic link (which he shares with Red and Elspeth), the party learns crucial information:\nFrankie and his pack have been driven to attack the town due to food scarcity caused by devils corrupting the forest The devils have been taking wolves as well as humans There\u0026rsquo;s a shrine in the woods that has been compromised by devil activity Frankie is reluctant to eat humans, finding it disturbing Elspeth steps forward to negotiate, using her natural diplomatic instincts despite her lack of charisma training. Through persuasion and the promise of healing, the party successfully recruits Frankie as an ally. Red heals both Frankie and another injured wolf, cementing their alliance.\nRetired Detective Olivia Cooper heroically wrestles Magnolia away from one of the wolves in a display of impressive athletics, showcasing her \u0026ldquo;water aerobics\u0026rdquo; training to great effect.\nPreparing for War # The party stabilizes and heals Magnolia, bringing her back to consciousness. However, they face a dilemma about what to do with her, as she\u0026rsquo;s technically a communist revolutionary scheduled to execute an innocent woman. After debate about tying her to a tree or bringing her along, they ultimately decide to send her back to town on Olivia\u0026rsquo;s summoned goat.\nFrankie explains that while he\u0026rsquo;d like to bring his pack to fight the devils, they\u0026rsquo;re too frightened after suffering heavy losses. He agrees to accompany the party alone, warning them that time is limited as his transformation won\u0026rsquo;t last indefinitely.\nThe party takes a short rest to recover, with Helisanna providing bardic inspiration to Silas, Elspeth, and Red using her musical abilities. Bru notably doesn\u0026rsquo;t receive inspiration, continuing their playful antagonistic relationship.\nThe Corrupted Shrine # The party approaches a cavern marked by glowing red runic symbols along the stone walls. Red and Olivia, with their divine connections, feel the strong presence of infernal corruption emanating from the area. The group decides on a stealthy approach rather than charging in.\nRolling an impressive group stealth check (with Silas achieving a remarkable total of 30), the party successfully infiltrates the cavern undetected. They discover a massive chamber containing:\nFour figures: Three devils positioned around a large altar, and one figure floating above it The floating figure is identified as Ophelia, an elven communist the party had previously captured and released Red\u0026rsquo;s exceptional religion check (natural 20, total 25) allows him to identify the three devil types: a healer, a damage dealer, and a tank Red recognizes the ritual taking place as one that will strengthen the devils\u0026rsquo; hold on this reality, making immediate action necessary.\nDevil Combat - Opening Moves # Initiative Order: Red (17), Silas (16), Elspeth (15), Frankie (14), Bru (12), Helisanna (8), Olivia (6)\nThe party gets the jump on the devils, launching their assault:\nRed begins by casting Emboldening Bond, connecting Silas, Helisanna, and (reluctantly) Bru with divine energy that allows them to add d4 to their rolls.\nSilas moves to engage the healer devil, throwing daggers with sneak attack damage despite rolling poorly on damage dice. His Vex weapon mastery ensures his follow-up attack will have advantage.\nElspeth charges in with BoxBox, positioning her steel defender to protect allies while attempting diplomacy one final time. When this fails, she attacks the minor devil with her gun, landing one hit out of multiple attempts.\nFrankie proves his worth immediately, delivering a devastating critical hit with his bite and claw attacks against the brute devil, dealing significant damage and establishing himself as a valuable ally.\nBru attempts to use Color Spray on the brute but discovers the devil has too many hit points for the spell to take effect. The devil merely enjoys the colorful display.\nHelisanna tries Tasha\u0026rsquo;s Hideous Laughter on the minor devil but fails to overcome its wisdom save despite using cutting words to modify the roll.\nOlivia charges the minor devil with her battle axe, landing a solid hit enhanced by Divine Smite for radiant damage, though failing to knock the devil prone with her Topple weapon mastery.\nDevil Retaliation # The devils respond with devastating area-of-effect attacks:\nThe Infernal Ravager releases a massive hellfire explosion in a 20-foot radius, forcing dexterity saves from most of the party. The 27 fire damage (half on successful save) severely injures multiple party members:\nSeveral party members fail their saves and take full damage Red uses his Stone\u0026rsquo;s Endurance racial ability to reduce some damage The party\u0026rsquo;s health pools are significantly depleted The Brute devil attacks Frankie with multiple strikes while emanating necrotic damage to nearby creatures, further wearing down the party.\nThe Minor Devil attempts to inflict bane on nearby enemies and tries to corrupt allies while healing itself and the brute for substantial amounts.\nMid-Combat Healing and Recovery # Red recognizes the dire situation and uses his Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace, allowing him to move his full distance while healing any creature within 5 feet during his movement. This strategic ability lets him heal multiple party members:\nSilas receives healing dice Olivia gets healed from near-death Bru and Helisanna also benefit from the divine healing Red supplements this with Healing Word on himself, demonstrating the crucial role of battlefield healing.\nHowever, the Ravager follows up with another area explosion, dealing 27 fire damage again and downing both Olivia and Frankie, showing just how deadly these devil encounters can be.\nTurning the Tide # The party rallies with impressive teamwork:\nSilas eliminates the Infernal Ravager with precise dagger throws, using his advantage from Vex and dealing substantial sneak attack damage in a cinematic jumping attack over Elspeth.\nElspeth rushes to revive Olivia, throwing herself protectively over the fallen paladin while using her healing abilities. BoxBox provides consistent damage against the remaining devils.\nBru finally gets his Eldritch Cannon back online (having been without it due to no long rest), deploying a Force Ballista that provides both consistent damage and tactical positioning with its push effect.\nHelisanna shifts to her Warlock abilities, casting Hex and then Eldritch Blast with devastating effect, landing a critical hit that eliminates the Minor Devil with a spectacular display of force energy.\nFinal Confrontation # With only the Brute devil remaining, the party focuses fire:\nOlivia, revived and furious, channels her Divine Strike and Imbued Weapon abilities to deal massive radiant damage. Her attacks cut through the devil \u0026ldquo;like infernal butter,\u0026rdquo; showcasing the devastating effectiveness of paladin abilities against fiends.\nFrankie, despite being knocked unconscious and briefly reverting to human form, proves his mettle throughout the fight with consistent high damage.\nThe final devil falls to Olivia\u0026rsquo;s righteous fury as she delivers the killing blow, demonstrating the \u0026ldquo;bloodthirsty Olivia\u0026rdquo; persona that emerges when fighting evil.\nResolution and Aftermath # As the devils die, their blood and energy flow into the altar\u0026rsquo;s symbols, briefly intensifying the ritual around Ophelia. Just as the situation seems to worsen, Eleanor arrives with perfect timing, raising her amulet and beginning a cleansing chant.\nEleanor\u0026rsquo;s divine magic successfully purifies the shrine, causing:\nThe devil bodies to disintegrate completely The ritual to be disrupted and reversed The shrine\u0026rsquo;s corruption to be cleansed The forest\u0026rsquo;s natural balance to begin restoration Character Moments and Development # The session showcases significant character development:\nRed emerges as a crucial support character, his divine healing abilities proving essential for party survival. His religious knowledge also proves invaluable for understanding the threats they face.\nOlivia displays a fierce protective instinct and righteous fury against evil, establishing her as a formidable frontline fighter when her divine abilities are properly utilized.\nElspeth continues her role as the party\u0026rsquo;s heart, rushing to help fallen allies and attempting diplomatic solutions even in dire circumstances.\nSilas demonstrates tactical thinking and adaptability, using his psychic abilities for communication and his combat skills for precise strikes.\nBru struggles without his signature abilities but adapts by working with his cannon and providing what support he can.\nHelisanna shows her versatility by switching between bard and warlock abilities as the situation demands.\nTechnical and Strategic Notes # The combat showcases several important D\u0026amp;D mechanics:\nThe effectiveness of area healing abilities in emergency situations The devastating power of coordinated area-of-effect attacks from enemies The importance of tactical positioning and teamwork The value of having diverse damage types and abilities The power scaling of higher-level play with more impactful abilities The party\u0026rsquo;s recruitment of Frankie demonstrates creative problem-solving and the potential benefits of turning enemies into allies through roleplay rather than combat.\nConclusion # The session ends with the immediate threat resolved but the party significantly depleted. They\u0026rsquo;ve successfully:\nRescued Magnolia (though sending her away) Cleansed the corrupted shrine Eliminated the devil threat Restored balance to the forest Gained a powerful werewolf ally The victory comes at a cost, with most party members badly injured and resources depleted, setting up the need for significant rest and recovery before their next adventure. The successful completion of this dangerous mission demonstrates the party\u0026rsquo;s growing effectiveness as a team and their ability to handle serious supernatural threats.\nThe episode title \u0026ldquo;Out of the frying pan, into the Fire\u0026rdquo; proves prophetic, as the party moves from the dangerous wolf encounter directly into an even more perilous devil confrontation, barely surviving through teamwork, tactical thinking, and a bit of luck.\n","date":"26 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-12/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party pursues werewolves, recruits an unlikely ally, and faces their most dangerous battle yet.","title":"12: Out of the frying pan, into the Fire","type":"sessions"},{"content":" 🕳️ Descent into the Tunnels # The session begins where the last left off: the party is led by Roscoe into a hidden series of tunnels beneath the town—once used to smuggle pilgrims of Tyr toward the mountain pass. They arrive at a meadery and dining hall where Roscoe cryptically offers to share “all of his secrets” if the party will drink his specially made Everclear: a magically potent potato alcohol distilled to purity. Before they can fully orient themselves, Roscoe sends Red a telepathic message asking, “Do you trust your compatriots?”\nThe message throws Red into confusion. Speaking aloud, he unsettles the group, who believe he may be hearing voices again. Silas connects himself, Red, and Bru into a psychic mind link to investigate further. Red continues to think out loud, and the group debates whether he’s genuinely dimwitted or just unfiltered. This initiates a series of multi-layered conversations—some aloud, some telepathic, some psychic side-chats—that begins to unravel the social trust and mystery around Roscoe’s true nature.\n🧪 The Everclear Test # Roscoe clarifies that the psychic message was from him, but takes great delight in misleading the party. He offers to reveal the truth about Red’s past—but only if they all drink with him. What follows is a half-hour-long peer-pressure sequence in which each party member reluctantly takes shots of Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s Everclear.\nBru demands the alcohol be “brown” and attempts to add dirt. Roscoe fiercely objects to “tainting” his purity. Bru finally drinks the clear liquor and secretly pours dirt into his mouth mid-sip, proudly proclaiming “It was brown in my mouth.” Silas, skeptical and unimpressed, drinks without fanfare and remains steady. Helisanna drinks and holds her own despite the alcohol’s nearly caustic potency. Red, who is canonically not a drinker, is caught in a vortex of social pressure, shame, and curiosity. After being peer pressured from every direction, he drinks—with dirt added mid-sip—and is immediately inebriated but jovial. Elspeth and Olivia offer dry commentary, with Olivia eventually healing Red post-binge with Lesser Restoration. 📖 Red’s True Identity Revealed # Once Red drinks, Roscoe gives him a journal belonging to his mother, Marion Cross. The journal, which Red reads aloud to himself while crying in the tunnels beneath his childhood home, reveals staggering truths:\nRed is adopted, which most of the party already suspected. His real name is Thurnok Skyhammer, and he is a Goliath prince from the Skyhammer clan. His parents were not random pilgrims—they were placed in hiding by the Twilight Company to protect Red from the Eldoran Empire. The Crosses raised him in secret and were likely murdered, not taken by illness as the town claimed. The emotional weight of the journal devastates Red, who is wrestling with revelations about his identity, lineage, and the loss of his adoptive family. He remains in a dissociative daze, eventually retreating into his childhood room—which has been stripped and desecrated by squatters.\n👮 Interrogation of the Intruders # While Red reads and processes his identity crisis, the rest of the party turns their attention to the two interlopers who have taken over his family home: Ophelia (an elven woman) and Doc (an orc male). After incapacitating them in a surprise attack, the party handcuffs the duo, ties them to chairs, and begins an extended interrogation.\nOlivia takes the lead, using her former detective persona to extract truths. Silas summons his psychic daggers and threatens to implant their worst memories in their minds—a dark and unsettling turn that proves effective. The captives reveal that the town has fallen under control of the Milstrom Party, a cult-like communist faction led by a mysterious figure known as Red Lennon. They admit that monthly sacrifices are made at an old druidic shrine in the forest to “keep Red Lennon happy.” Red Lennon\u0026rsquo;s power appears supernatural—capable of cursing the town if not appeased. The shrine is believed to be connected to a portal, and only those with red armbands (like the captives) are allowed to witness the rituals. Once they extract all they can, the party knocks the two out again and—fully in line with their chaotic alignment—throws the captives, still in their chairs, into the Bag of Holding.\n🐺 Attack of the Wolves # The moment of catharsis is shattered by sounds of screaming and chaos outside. Wolves—massive, intelligent, and terrifying—have descended upon the town. Roscoe warns the group with his usual ambiguous flair, but the danger is immediate.\nThe party emerges from the tunnel into the basement of the Common Mug inn, shoving through a barricade to find townsfolk in full panic. Five wolves are actively assaulting townspeople and attempting to break into the inn. In the chaos, Red spots a massive dire wolf dragging a screaming woman (Magnolia Redguard) into the woods.\n⚔️ The Battle in the Streets # The group launches into an intense urban skirmish:\nHelisanna draws her axe (her Pact Weapon) and cleaves wolves down in close combat. Bru unleashes a Thunderwave spell, blasting wolves back and doing significant area damage. Silas uses psychic daggers to devastating effect, using sneak attacks and stealth to outmaneuver foes. Olivia engages with her divine smite and battle axe, applying pressure to the strongest wolves. Elspeth and BoxBox coordinate ranged and melee strikes to great effect, wounding multiple wolves at once. Red uses Balm of Peace and healing magic to keep the party alive while also psychically spiraling from the revelations of his parentage and the sound of Magnolia\u0026rsquo;s screams fading into silence. After the brutal brawl, the wolves retreat—but not before leaving behind wounded townsfolk and a shaken party. Red is left grappling with the knowledge that Magnolia, who supposedly witnessed his parents’ murder, may now be dead or worse.\n🧠 Character Arcs \u0026amp; Emotional Shifts # Red / Thurnok Skyhammer: Moves from naïve foundling to a potentially displaced prince with a traumatic past and dangerous destiny. Roscoe: Grows even more enigmatic. His combination of cryptic wisdom, drunken philosophical waxing, and unsettling honesty keeps the party on edge. He seems deeply invested in Red’s awakening. Silas: Leans further into his morally grey persona, using psychic threats and back-alley tactics for results. He becomes Red’s unspoken guardian as things unravel. Helisanna: Balances chaotic humor with raw power, revealing her musical and magical fury in equal measure. Olivia: Anchors the team with lawful conviction, but begins to blur lines with her intimidating methods. Elspeth: Keeps calm and focused, contributing significantly to the battle and showing her capability as a reliable support and damage dealer. Bru: Continues to play the wildcard—blending bombs, humor, and a taste for destruction while subtly showing care for Red and the group. 🧩 Loose Threads # Magnolia Redguard has been dragged away by wolves. Her fate is unknown. She may be the only person who witnessed Red’s parents\u0026rsquo; death. Willemay, the dissenting voice in town, is still scheduled for execution within a few hours. Red Lennon’s role as both political leader and magical threat has yet to be addressed. The Druidic Shrine—long known to be a place of power—is possibly a portal, a blight source, and the focal point of the cult’s activities. Roscoe’s nature remains suspicious. He may be a warforged Peaceforged soldier, once part of a psychic hive-mind led by a being named SHIELD. 📜 Memorable Quotes # “It was brown in my mouth.” – Bru, after spiking his Everclear with dirt\n“You know, Roscoe, I don’t really drink…” – Red, just before spiraling into identity collapse\n“I am a liar. And I can also be a hypocrite.” – Roscoe\n“You’re giving me mildly autistic vibes in a creepy way.” – Olivia, to Roscoe\n“Roscoe’s Everclear: You Only Live Once.” – Roscoe, marketing his drink\n“Everything about Red’s life is a lie.” – Roscoe\n🏁 Session End # The wolves are driven off. The townspeople cheer the party’s heroism, but the weight of what was uncovered still hangs heavy:\nRed has a new name, a forgotten kingdom, and a lost inheritance. A friend who could shed light on his parents may be dead. A sacrificial cult runs the town. And time is running out before Willemay is executed. The party stands at a crossroads, caught between heroism, revenge, and revolution.\nNext stop: the shrine—and maybe Red Lennon.\n","date":"19 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-11/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party drinks Roscoe’s Everclear and uncovers Red’s royal past while wolves descend on the town","title":"11: You Only Live Once","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Recap of Previous Events # The party had escaped High Forge and began traveling with a large caravan. They met Eleanor’s Wandering Coven, got introduced to a magic guild, and helped Fred, who now provides them with info. Fred brought them the case of Bori, a boy in a coma due to a deal made with a mysterious entity named Crowley. The party retrieved a fox totem from a shrine after solving a moonlight puzzle and fighting a guardian, then gave it to Crowley. Bori and his family recovered. Journey Toward Milstrom # The caravan travels along a blighted, eerie landscape toward Milstrom. At a crossroads, the party meets two intimidating Eldoran Knights warning travelers to avoid Milstrom. The knights say the town has changed, hinting at dangerous, mind-affecting forces. The party, citing numerous quests tied to Milstrom, decides to proceed despite warnings. Context for Milstrom # The group lists their reasons for entering Milstrom:\nA blight affecting Eleanor’s shrine. The mystery surrounding the mayor’s disappearance and rumors of a political collective. The last known location of Finnegan and George (Project Purple Patch). A potential portal to hell. Red\u0026rsquo;s personal ties: family history and suspected involvement of the Twilight Company. Possible show venue for Helisanna at the Common Mug tavern. Enter: The Vroomfall \u0026amp; Party Debate # The party discusses tactics (talking vs. explosions) in their crowded Vroomfall van, full of allies and passengers. Political and social topics emerge, including the status of tieflings, who are recent hellspawn refugees, and commentary on racial/species mechanics in D\u0026amp;D. The party debates decision-making processes and considers votes, brute strength, and past combat performance. Arrival at Milstrom # They talk their way past the Eldoran Knights checkpoint with Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s help, receiving a brooch to report back with findings. The town appears unusually orderly and proud. The forest is blighted, and the townspeople wear red armbands. The Common Mug tavern is the social center. There are no street vendors or signs of a typical free market economy. Tobias the blacksmith mentions a collectivist movement led by someone named Red Lennon. Meet Roscoe # The party meets Roscoe, a bizarre old Warforged with a makeshift digestive system from wish magic. Roscoe, clearly eccentric and alcoholic, offers valuable knowledge in exchange for beer—a lot of it. The party stealthily steals a keg from the tavern while the town holds a public trial. Show Trial at the Common Mug # The party witnesses a chilling communist-style public tribunal. A woman named Willemay Hargreave is sentenced to execution at dawn for “counter-revolutionary activity.” Her accusations: questioning Red Lennon’s regime and warning about creeping authoritarianism. Tunnels and Revelations # In exchange for the keg, Roscoe reveals: A hidden trapdoor that leads to tunnels beneath Milstrom, used by pilgrims to avoid the town. Directions to the corrupted shrine, detailed via a drunkenly hand-drawn but decipherable map. Information about Willemay’s dissent and religious alignment (devoted to Tyr). Confirmation that the town is under subtle magical corruption stemming from Red Lennon—a literal devil from hell. Insights about Olivia\u0026rsquo;s nephew Finnegan and George, who passed through these tunnels in pursuit of a pilgrimage. The Pilgrim Route and Next Steps # The party uses Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s tunnels and map to plan their approach. They face moral quandaries: Should they intervene in Willemay’s execution? Can they defeat Red Lennon and break his corruptive influence on the town? Olivia and Elspeth reflect on familial ties and motivations. Roscoe encourages them to act quickly, warning of Red Lennon’s hold on the town’s morality and politics. Notable NPCs Introduced # Roscoe – A drunken Warforged with a self-modified digestive system, deep knowledge of the town, and tragic yet comedic undertones. Tobias – Friendly blacksmith, neutral on politics. Willemay Hargreave – Elven woman and outspoken dissenter sentenced to execution. Red Lennon – Devilish communist leader corrupting Milstrom from behind the scenes. Eldoran Knights – Cautious guards stationed outside Milstrom. Key Threads Moving Forward # Investigate and potentially cleanse the shrine causing the blight. Stop Willemay’s execution and uncover more about Red Lennon’s control. Use underground tunnels for stealth and recon. Follow leads regarding Finnegan, George, and Project Purple Patch. Maintain faction reputation and balance public-facing actions with the risk of exposure.

After a restful night, a new supernatural mystery involving a comatose child draws the party eastward into the woods and deeper into the realms of fae influence.\nParty Members Present # Helisanna – Human Bard/Warlock Elspeth Cooper – Dwarf Battlesmith Artificer/Paladin Felonias \u0026ldquo;Bru\u0026rdquo; Bru – Goblin Artillerist Artificer Retired Detective Olivia Cooper – Dwarf Devotion Paladin Red – Absent PC played by another player (healer) Silas – Remains asleep, not part of the night’s excursion Plot Events # A Midnight Emergency # Fred the gopher (from previous sessions) bursts into camp seeking Red\u0026rsquo;s healing help. A child in the camp, Bori, has mysteriously fallen into a coma the same night his mother, Sela, awakened from her months-long coma. Olivia, Elspeth, and Red respond, leaving the rest asleep. Grogi, a friend of Bori’s, recounts that the boys met a “weird man in a white suit and top hat” in the woods the day before, who offered to \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo; Bori’s mother in exchange for a trade. Olivia uses Divine Sense and detects a faint trace of evil on Bori but not on his mother. Gathering the Team # Olivia wakes Helisanna and Bru without alerting Silas. Silas remains asleep in the van. The group agrees to investigate the mysterious encounter from the day before. Red’s medical check confirms that healing won’t help Bori—his state is magical in nature. Into the Woods # The Crossroads Encounter # Following Grogi’s directions, the party ventures into the eerie eastern woods under moonlight, accompanied by Red. At a crossroads, they hear humming—“Pop Goes the Weasel”—followed by the poem “The Tyger” by William Blake. A fae named Mr. Crowley appears: white suit, opera mask, pointy teeth, charming yet disturbing. He confirms he struck a deal with Bori, who gave up his own consciousness to save his mother’s life. Crowley offers a new deal: retrieve a fox-shaped fae totem from an ancient shrine in exchange for restoring Bori’s consciousness without reverting Sela back into her coma. Journey to the Shrine # The Midnight Pool # Guided by a magical mote of light Crowley provides, the party finds a hidden shrine in the heart of the woods. They uncover a dry celestial pool surrounded by old mirrors. When moonlight is properly reflected using the mirrors, a hidden staircase opens beneath the pool. Guardian of the Shrine # Within the shrine, they find the totem on a fallen pedestal. As Helisanna approaches, a skeletal bear with ram’s horns and green fire eyes emerges. A battle ensues: Bru and Red\u0026rsquo;s fire spells are particularly effective. Olivia and Boxbox (Elspeth’s steel defender) make a strong defensive duo, using reactions to deflect attacks. Elspeth and Helisanna contribute with ranged and melee attacks. The bear is destroyed after Olivia lands a devastating smite attack. The Decision # Helisanna picks up the totem. Elspeth uses Identify and confirms it’s a powerful conjuration-linked item: a Fae anchor for the spirit known as Toonlock. A ritual could potentially summon Toonlock, but the components are unknown. The group debates whether to give the totem to Crowley, fearing long-term consequences. Ultimately, they choose to honor the deal. Return to Crowley # Crowley appears at the crossroads, genuinely pleased. He accepts the totem and assures them Bori will awaken and he will leave the area in peace. Helisanna shakes his hand, sealing the deal. Crowley vanishes into the earth, leaving only his smile lingering in the air. Epilogue # Back at the refugee camp, the party sees the family joyfully reunited: Bori, Sela, and Turek are all awake and well. Olivia warns Hoboken (the monk of Tyr) to spread word about Crowley and to warn others against making fae bargains. The party ends the night wary but victorious—having saved a child’s life, made a deal with a devilish fae, and unleashed possible consequences for the future. Notable Roleplay Moments # Crowley’s eerie charm and poetic cadence adds gravitas to the fae bargain. Helisanna’s playful yet bold nature shines during her interactions with Crowley and her curiosity around the totem. Olivia’s legalistic, justice-focused objection to fae deals adds moral weight. Elspeth’s utility and coordination with Boxbox make her a tactical powerhouse. Bru’s love of fire causes a few forest fires, humorously downplayed. Red’s support spells and pacifist nature play a quiet but critical role. Themes # Moral ambiguity: Should a deal with a fae be upheld for a good outcome? Innocence and cost: A child’s sacrifice underscores the theme of exploitation. Choices and consequences: The long-term effect of giving Crowley what he wants remains unclear. Session MVP # Crowley – For stealing every scene he was in and ratcheting up the creep factor in the best way possible.\n","date":"5 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-9/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party enters the woods to break a fae bargain and strikes a dangerous deal with Mr. Crowley.","title":"9: A Stranger at the Crossroads","type":"sessions"},{"content":"The primary villains and cosmic threats that have shaped the party\u0026rsquo;s journey, ranging from street-level criminals to cosmic entities bent on universal domination.\nCrowley (Mr. Crowley / Fergus the Serpent Tongue) # First Appearance: Session 9 - \u0026ldquo;A Stranger at the Crossroads\u0026rdquo;\nRace: Fae Entity (Archfey/Cosmic Power)\nProfession: Crossroads Devil, Bargain Maker, Ancient Cosmic Manipulator\nAffiliations: The Feywild Courts, Ancient cosmic entities, Alliance with Eldora\nPhysical Description: Manifests as a figure in an immaculate white suit and top hat with an opera mask covering his face, revealing only pointed teeth and an unnervingly charming smile.

As they rejoin a larger caravan of fleeing citizens and merchants, the group maintains a low profile while still accompanied by Bo, the Twilight Company remnants, and the now-painted vehicles: Vroomfall and Zoomfall.\nVan aesthetics update: Vroomfall now features the iconic “Three Steve Moon” (wolves wearing sunglasses) howling at a stylized moon. Zoomfall is painted in a Mad Max–inspired style, waiting on Ellie’s final flair. 🧪 A Wave of Revelations # The session opens with a retrospective on Silas’ backstory:\nSilas and Bru were once part of a gang that stole a powerful artifact from the criminal syndicate The Iron Claws. The stolen item is a glass orb containing a dragon, which is extremely dangerous if mishandled (e.g. stored in a Bag of Holding). The Iron Claws are now actively pursuing Silas by name—meaning his current identity has been compromised. Other shocking reveals include:\nOlivia’s friend, Bo Dega, is implicated in drug smuggling—using produce to transport a dangerous eye-drop drug called \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo;. Olivia is devastated to learn her local bodega may have been a front for narcotics. 💰 Loot Recap \u0026amp; Equipment Shopping # The group discusses gold totals:\nEveryone received 2,000g, contributed 666g each for a Bag of Holding, leaving 1,334g remaining per player. Olivia, Elspeth, and others consider what items to buy. Common and uncommon items are approved. Clarifications about heavy armor proficiencies are made, especially with updated 2024 rules. Healing potions are recommended for low-slot clerics. 🌄 Traveling Toward Milstrom # The party travels with the caravan toward Milstrom, Red\u0026rsquo;s hometown.\nBo questions what’s next for him after High Forge. Olivia tries to keep him on the moral path. Silas confesses he\u0026rsquo;s rattled that his “clean” identity was discovered by the Iron Claws. The party confirms the town\u0026rsquo;s name is Milstrom, though it takes a while to recall. 🛑 Paladin Encounter: Religious Persecution # A disturbing road encounter introduces Eldoran paladins—human knights wielding weapons and armor embedded with violessence crystals (the same material powering Elspeth’s racer).\nThey are forcing refugees to swear allegiance to Empress Eldora, demanding abandonment of their former gods. A knight accosts a dwarven monk who refuses to forsake Tyr. Olivia, Elspeth, and Red intervene—Olivia tries diplomacy, Elspeth supports, and Silas pretends she’s a senile grandma to de-escalate. Silas rolls a 29 deception, diffusing the situation. The monk, named Hoboken, joins the caravan under the party’s protection. ⛺ Campsite Revelations and Side Missions # The caravan stops for the night at a seasonal festival site turned refugee camp. Players pursue side activities:\nHelisanna # Drinks with caravan guards and trades stories about the dragons and Eldoran knights. Learns of another caravan approaching with more paladins a day behind them. Red # Performs triage on injured refugees, healing a severely burned boy using Healing Word. Befriends the boy’s father, Frederick, who insists on repaying the party by joining them and offering his services. Silas # Takes Frederick under his wing, probing him for intelligence. Learns that Project Purple Patch, a mysterious effort related to missing Tyr pilgrims, seems centered around Milstrom. Confirms that Red’s family was likely involved in the coven—raising more mystery around their deaths. Discusses promoting another Helisanna concert to earn gold. Elspeth # Acquires 20 spare car parts from Trevor, a mechanic merchant. Silas negotiates a sponsorship deal for discounted parts in exchange for promoting Trevor’s brand. 🧭 Arrival of Tien \u0026amp; Tiefling Lore Drop # The party meets Tien, their employer from the Steven Guild.\nTien reveals that his entire family are Tiefling refugees from Avernus, having escaped through a rift in the mountains. This is the first canon introduction of Tieflings into the world—players are stunned. The family brought wealth and skills with them, earning a place in society and launching a merchant operation. 📜 Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s Offer: The Blight and the Hearth Seed # The party is approached by Eleanor, a halfling hedge mage from Eleanor’s Wandering Coven:\nShe asks for help taking a Hearth Seed to a Druidic Altar near Milstrom to counteract a mysterious blight affecting the area. She implies that this may be linked to deeper corruption or the nearby hell rift. Red is visibly disturbed—his hometown is falling apart. 📋 The Milstrom To-Do List # The session ends with the party compiling a running list of objectives in Milstrom:\nInvestigate the blight and help restore the Druidic altar. Locate the hell rift and determine its threat. Investigate the disappearance of Mayor Jed Carter. Follow leads on Project Purple Patch and the missing Tyr pilgrims, possibly linked to Red’s family. Figure out the new government structure of Milstrom. Set up a Helisanna concert for funds and influence. Reconnect with Finnegan, a go-between for the Twilight Company. Fred also returns, having located 100 MP3 blanks and assisting with acquiring them for the next concert.\n🌙 Final Thoughts # The party rests under the stars as Bo\u0026rsquo;s caravan and Tien\u0026rsquo;s family merge with their group. Helisanna is drunk, Red is contemplative, Silas is scheming, and Olivia remains ever vigilant. With their next destination looming, Milstrom promises answers—but also deeper mystery and danger.\n","date":"3 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-8/","section":"Sessions","summary":"Tacocats take a moment to meet caravan folks.","title":"8: Caravan Nights","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Escape From the Race and Into the Fire # The session begins immediately after the conclusion of the race, with the party still in the Vroomfall. Suddenly, explosions are heard from the direction of the Market Ward — possibly indicating a dragon attack. The party, joined by Elspeth who loads her car into the Vroomfall, quickly debates their escape route from the city.\nPlotting a Tunnel Escape # They consider taking the old, secret tunnels beneath the city, once used by royalty and now largely forgotten. Though none of them are experts, Olivia recalls encountering smugglers who may have used the tunnels, and Bru and Silas speculate that their Twilight Company contact Victor may know a way out. However, Little Hovel, where Victor might be, is in the Market Ward — the area currently under siege.\nWith no better options, the party resolves to head toward the chaos to rescue Victor. Olivia also remembers that Bo Dega, is at her apartment, which is along the way.\nDriving Into the Market Ward # They begin the drive into the Market Ward against the flow of traffic. Guards at the gate are shocked but let them through. As they enter, they see dragons dive-bombing buildings, fireballs raining down, and a glowing golden magical dome protecting thousands of citizens. Jasper spots golden-armored soldiers forming this protective bubble using connected crystal shields — not High Forge soldiers, possibly Eldoran in origin.\nPicking Up Victor and Bo Dega # In the chaos, Elspeth is sent to retrieve Bo Dega separately. The rest of the party drives to Little Hovel, dodging dragon fire via group dexterity saves (blessed and bard-inspired), taking fire damage along the way. They finally find Victor, frantically trying to rescue a mix of essential and ridiculous items — including Girl Scout cookies, a piranha gun, and a folder of old tunnel maps (which he does not realize are valuable).\nVictor is roped into the van and interrogated. He reveals he doesn’t know the tunnels himself but has the folder full of mining routes — potentially useful to navigate out. Olivia grabs it, and the group continues the escape.\nMore Fire, More Problems # Another fireball comes close, prompting another save. Red casts Prayer of Healing to top up the injured party. As they head back toward the gate to exit the Market Ward, one dragon clamps onto it, partially holding it open. The party debates using distractions and illusions to slip by. They attempt a combo: Helisanna casts Minor Illusion of a golden knight while Bru fires his Force Ballista. The illusion nearly works, but the dragon sees through it and retaliates.\nA successful round of saves and creative buffs lets them survive the hit. Red lays on hands to keep people stable. They blast through the gate — just barely making it as the dragon claws into the Great Hall.\nInto the Mines # Inside the now-empty Great Hall, the party heads for the mine entrance. They hear Victor’s sending stone ring and eavesdrop on a call from Twilight Company associate Mira, who informs them the Iron Claws gang is controlling tunnel access and charging fees. Olivia realizes that Helja Ungart, the gang\u0026rsquo;s leader, is an old nemesis who would definitely recognize her — and Silas too, who is now revealed to have stolen a mysterious object from her.\nThe Stolen Orb # Silas produces a swirling, galaxy-filled glass orb, the object of the heist that cost his former crew their lives. Victor calls it a communication device to another plane or being. Olivia touches it — sees a cosmic dragon-like being, and hears it speak her name. She takes psychic damage but learns it knows her deeply.\nThe party debates where to hide the orb, almost placing it in the bag of holding before recalling that could risk catastrophic dimensional collapse. It\u0026rsquo;s safely returned to a regular pack.\nPlans and Disguises # At the aquafarm near the tunnel entrance, they rendezvous with Bo Dega and the Twilight Company crew (Cyrus, Mira, Lanny, Courtney). The party prepares to sneak past the Iron Claws with a multi-layered plan:\nPaint the Vroomfall to disguise it. Use disguise kits on the more recognizable members. Hide Red and Silas in the bag of holding (without the orb). Hide Helisanna, Elspeth, and Brew in produce crates. During prep, they discover the Twilight Company\u0026rsquo;s crates are full of an illegal drug called \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo; — a red liquid taken as eyedrops. Olivia demands they abandon the cargo or use it as bribe material. Lanny and Courtney reluctantly agree and sink the crates in the hydroponic lake.\nCrossing the Checkpoint # With all disguises prepped, Olivia leads the caravan to the checkpoint, supported by Bo. A tough negotiation ensues with the Iron Claw thugs, who demand 500 gold. Olivia successfully persuades them to accept 450, and the party moves through safely.\nThe Long March and Freedom # They drive for hours through guarded tunnel paths, finally emerging onto the other side of the mountain under a sky of stars. The escape is successful. Victor is overjoyed; Olivia sternly warns Bo this is his one and only pass for getting involved in crime.\nEndgame and Reflections # The party plans to continue toward their next job. Loose ends:\nThe orb is powerful and mysterious — potentially a link to a divine being or dragon. Silas has a bounty on his head and a past with Helja. Olivia’s grandson is still missing, and their journey will lead them closer to that mystery. Red, Helisanna, and Elspeth all have reasons to move forward toward the next city. As the session ends, they prepare to meet their escort at the upcoming rendezvous point, disguises intact, dragon behind them, and dangers still ahead.\nNotable Character Developments:\nOlivia: Uses Lay on Hands, leads negotiations, and interacts with the orb, gaining direct contact with a cosmic dragon. Silas: Revealed to be the target of a major gang due to a heist; hides in the bag of holding. Bru: Leans into criminal connections, provides artillery distraction. Red: Uses key cleric support spells (Bless, Emboldening Bond, Prayer of Healing). Elspeth \u0026amp; Helisanna: Though more in the background, actively involved in crate disguise and navigating escape. New Factions Introduced:\nGolden Knights: Mysterious, Eldoran-associated figures who protect civilians from dragon attacks using a magical shield. Iron Claws: Ruthless gang led by Helja Ungart, charging tolls and locking down the tunnels. Victor: A Despicable Me-inspired Twilight Company techie with comic relief and potential plot utility. Items of Interest:\nThe Orb: A glass sphere linking to a cosmic dragon entity. Piranha Gun: A joke weapon pulled from Victor’s haul. Bag of Holding: Now party-owned, used to hide Silas and Red.

Our heroes seek to escape highforge!","title":"7: Escape Highforge","type":"sessions"},{"content":" 🎭 Major Events # Olivia\u0026rsquo;s Solo Investigations # Olivia investigates Finnegan\u0026rsquo;s Bakery, finding it suspiciously closed and hastily abandoned. She connects its sudden closure to the disappearance of a local figure and the growing dragon threat. She then visits Bo Dega, who is also shutting down his shop due to fear of approaching dragons. Olivia arranges for Bo Dega and his cat to join the group\u0026rsquo;s caravan, securing supplies and shelter. Group Reconvenes Over Breakfast # The group finally gathers and shares scattered info: dragons are real, approaching the city, and causing mass evacuations. This catches several members off guard. There is light-hearted bickering about the concert from the night before and whose actions were most impactful, with multiple characters claiming credit. Tensions briefly rise between Silas and Brew, and Helisanna is teased for her subpar performance. Planning for the Race # The group solidifies roles in the upcoming underground street race: Elspeth will drive the Doomfall. BoxBox (her automaton) rides in the back for support. Silas and Helisanna prepare sabotage and distraction tactics. Brew equips and plans the use of flamethrower cannons and caltrops. Red and Olivia offer support roles including healing, driving, and cannon operation. Tactical positions and sabotage plans are laid out, including: Trapping the narrow tunnel with caltrops (Silas). Stationing Helisanna at a key hairpin turn. Using flamethrower turrets mounted on the van. Olivia staying atop the van as mobile cannon support. Final Pre-Race Errands # Elspeth visits rival racer Divald to exchange small talk and gather intel. Silas collects payment from Twilight Company for prior sabotage work. Brew attempts to steal a communal liquor bottle in a failed scheme to poison rival racers — accidentally disrupting Silas’ own sabotage plan. 🏎️ The Race Begins # Elspeth lines up with nearly 50 racers. The team’s pre-race support is visualized as a surreal, symbolic combat encounter representing “the race” as a sentient monster. Players alternate between skill checks and combat mechanics in a shared narrative framework, effectively “fighting” the dangers of the race. Skill Challenge Highlights: # Silas expertly lays caltrops in the tunnel. Olivia intimidates a goblin team into vacating a key ambush spot. Red casts buffs and support magic like Emboldening Bond. Brew fires fireworks from roof-mounted cannons to detonate landmines. Elspeth benefits from multiple buffs (Cat’s Grace, Sanctuary, Shield of Faith) while dodging traps and maintaining high speed. 💥 Combat with the \u0026ldquo;Race\u0026rdquo; # The “Race” manifests as a mechanical, mobile nightmare that targets Elspeth. The party tactically overwhelms it using positioning, teamwork, and abilities like Hex, Smite, and psychic knives. Olivia lands a decisive hit with Divine Smite. Silas and Helisanna deal significant damage, while Red and Brew offer key support. 🏁 Victory # Elspeth overtakes the final racers using a clever fake-out maneuver and finishes with a jump across the final bridge — Fast \u0026amp; Furious-style. She\u0026rsquo;s awarded first place and a membership into the underground racing circuit. Just as the dust settles, dragons begin their assault on the city. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Party Role Breakdown # Character Role in Race Contributions Elspeth Driver Won the race; dodged traps; handled the car solo. Silas Saboteur Caltrops placement; psychic communication; combat support. Helisanna Spell Support Hexed the enemy; dished out Eldritch Blasts; morale support. Olivia Cannon/Support Intimidated enemy teams; landed big hits with her axe and Divine Smite. Brew Tinkerer Fired fireworks from cannon; activated Flamethrower. Red Healer/Pacifist Buffed allies (Shield of Faith, Emboldening Bond); supported from the van. 🐉 On the Horizon # Dragons have officially begun their attack on the city. The party must now coordinate an escape — possibly with Bo Dega and others in tow — setting the stage for a city exodus under fire.

They’re set to perform for thousands, with a lucrative 10,000 gold contract from their patron, Sandra. But the concert is just one part of the whirlwind — the illegal street race looms the next day.\nParty Preparations: # Helisana chills, channeling her inner rock star and preparing mentally for the concert. Elspeth inspects the car and the van, setting traps and preparing “BoxBox” (her steel defender) to watch the garage. She also builds a tripwire shotgun trap with an alarm spell for added security. Felonias Bru designs and installs two under-the-table pyro-cannons on either side of the concert stage — dual-purpose as fireworks and defense weapons. Total cost: 500 gold. Silas buys MP3-like “magic stones” to record the concert, investing in a recording kit and planning to resell the exclusive concert audio for profit. Red meditates, reflects, and prepares as a moral compass and on-site medic, with water-based crowd cooling ready. Olivia stays back at the garage with BoxBox, overseeing security and routine tasks. 🛠️ The Venue: Forge Heart # The Forge Heart is a legendary and archaic magma-forged anvil temple turned venue. It’s largely symbolic, with lava tubes and cavernous acoustics. The party outfits it with:\nFlame turrets Sound setups Recording systems (assembled by Elspeth) Firework launchers 🧃 Merchandising \u0026amp; Morality # Silas, ever the entrepreneur, plans to sell limited edition live recordings for 10–50 gold each. He schemes exclusivity and nostalgia-based marketing, channeling his rogue instincts into music distribution. Bru mocks the financial priorities, but secretly admires the hustle.\n💣 The Attack at the Show # Just before the show starts, Elspeth spots three suspicious dwarf-sized individuals approaching Silas and Sandra (who is delivering the first 6,000g payment). Combat erupts.\nElspeth blocks the goons and gets grappled. Silas evades capture, gets stabbed, then non-lethally incapacitates one attacker with a psychic knife. Red supports with Sanctuary and Emboldening Bond. Bru launches a mortar firework from the turrets, seriously injuring a goon. Sandra is nearly robbed of the briefcase but escapes. The party captures and incapacitates all three assailants before the show even starts. Suspiciously, the goons were after Silas — not the money. 🎶 The Concert: Chaos \u0026amp; Chords # The concert is chaotic but powerful:\nStart: Initial performance is lackluster (low roll), crowd grows impatient. Middle: Bru launches massive pyrotechnics to save the vibe. Red blesses Helisana with Enhance Ability. Crowd enthusiasm grows. Finale: Glowing-eyed crowd members join the stage as backup bandmates (possibly under infernal influence). Helisana rises via harness with firework “wings,” smoke blankets the stage. Epic finale saves the night. Despite Helisana’s middling rolls, the crowd is riveted by the violence, fireworks, and demonic vibes. 🔫 Surprise Ambush #2 # As the concert ends:\nFour more enemies try to assassinate Silas during the show’s final act. A second battle erupts live on stage. Silas gets shot but evades and retaliates from the crowd. Elspeth and Red join the fight, coordinating spiritual and physical takedowns. One assassin flees as Silas fails a final shot, despite clever positioning. 💰 Post-Concert Payoff # Silas successfully sells nearly all of his MP3s for 50 gold each, netting 5,000 gold. Sandra returns with the final 3,000 gold in a heavy briefcase — but not before criticizing the lack of security. The group realizes (too late) that they were supposed to run the venue themselves. Elspeth’s garage alarm goes off. 🚨 The Garage: Another Intrusion # Silas and Elspeth race back in a taxi, discovering:\nThe alarm was triggered. Two human “tracksuited” would-be saboteurs — a brother-sister duo — are found unconscious at the garage. Elspeth’s traps and alarm successfully fended them off. The duo admits they were hired to sabotage race competitors. 🍻 Denouement # The group splits: Red and Helisana go out drinking with Bru. Silas and Elspeth secure the garage. A mysterious cloaked figure approaches Brew and Red, asking for Silas. Red lies convincingly and they vanish. The crew tallies their haul: nearly 14,250 gold, an unusual amount for such a young party. 🔍 Session Highlights # 🎤 Helisana’s evolving rock-star mystique continues to grow despite middling rolls. 💼 Silas leans deep into capitalism and espionage. 🔧 Elspeth builds, traps, and throws herself into the race prep. 🔥 Bru’s fireworks absolutely saved the concert. 🛡️ Red shines as the protector and moral center — full support mode. 🧩 Threads \u0026amp; Loose Ends # The attackers seemed to know about the payment and targeted Silas specifically. Fans with glowing purple eyes may be linked to infernal or Twilight Company activity. The mystery figure looking for Silas adds more danger to his growing notoriety. Olivia and BoxBox continue to be crucial off-screen characters. The tracksuit twins might reappear.

Party Members Present # Silas Red Helisanna Bru (later) Olivia (temporarily NPC\u0026rsquo;d) Philbin (gnome NPC, captured and interrogated) Key Events # 1. Briefing at the Diner # Silas fills the team in on sabotage plans targeting Elspeth’s car. Twilight Company wants them to sabotage rival cars in Bay 10 and Bay 12. After paying for a meal and some banter with a chameleon-accented waitress, the group heads to the garage. 2. Surprise in the Van # Upon checking the garage and Elspeth’s bay, the party hears noises in their van. They discover three gnomes inside assembling a bomb. Combat breaks out: two gnomes are killed (via Eldritch Blast and melee), one is stabilized and captured. 3. Interrogating Philbin # Philbin reveals they were hired anonymously at \u0026ldquo;Arby’s\u0026rdquo; to sabotage the party’s car. He claims ignorance of the benefactor\u0026rsquo;s identity, describing them only as hooded and threatening. 4. Resurrecting the Gnomes # Red escorts the injured gnomes to a Temple of Tyr. An old cleric revives them. The party coerces the gnomes to finish the bomb and repurpose it to sabotage Bay 10’s car. 5. Sabotage Missions # Bay 10: Silas plants the finished bomb under a racecar while Helisanna distracts guards with a dramatic act. Bay 12: Silas and Bru sneak in. Bru welds the exhaust closed using artificer tools and spells. Silas stalls a suspicious dwarf with flirtation and misdirection. 6. Aftermath and Arby’s Recon # The group reconvenes. Bru is stationed to guard Elspeth’s car. The rest investigate Arby’s for leads on the mysterious saboteur. Interrogation of the front desk and Dirk yields no concrete info. Plan to use Minor Illusion to bait a reaction from suspects is discussed but not executed. Memorable Moments # “Castle Doctrine” humorously invoked to justify murder in their own garage. Philbin’s whining becomes a running gag. Silas’ seduction attempt of a dwarf is absurdly effective. Bru’s sabotage using artificer ingenuity. Arby’s as a hub for underground dealings—ironic given its mundane facade. Ongoing Threads # Mystery of the benefactor behind the gnome saboteurs. Who is trying to sabotage Elspeth? Is it connected to the Twilight Company? The Briefcase: Mentioned to be with Olivia; possibly a future plot thread. Arby’s stakeout: The group may continue to investigate there. Closing # Episode ends with a successful dual sabotage and a vague lead at Arby’s. The crew is exhausted, suspicious, and mildly traumatized but victorious.

Inside, she finds a set of color-coded journals authored by her grandson George, who was last known to be working with the Twilight Company. George’s notes detail a mysterious operation called Project Purple Patch, feuds among High Forge’s underground gangs, and a religious mission involving Father Jacob and Mother Asuka. George was last seen heading north on a pilgrimage tied to the Church of Tyr. Olivia finds a lead in the journals pointing toward a halfling named Finnegan, an information broker who has interfaced with both Twilight Company and the gang Iron Claws. Reuniting the Crew # Silas, Red, and Olivia reconvene at a garage after a period of scattered rest. The party shares updates: Red reveals a Twilight Company hit order against “Healing Touch” — his parents — marked with a certified stamp. Silas confirms the order looks official, despite the Twilight Company not typically engaging in contract killings. The group decides to dig deeper into the Twilight Company’s network and determine how and why Red’s parents were targeted. A Trip to the Cathedral # The trio visits the Cathedral of Tyr, which doubles as a courthouse and jail. Red grapples with the revelation that his pacifist beliefs may have been sheltered from the harsher doctrines of Tyr’s justice. Olivia secures a sealed letter of authority from the bishop, sanctioning her to investigate George’s disappearance on the Church\u0026rsquo;s behalf. The Twilight Company Meeting # The group attends an open Twilight Company meeting held under a bar called the Little Hobble. Silas, under the alias Martin Birchwood, marks himself as a member using Thieves’ Cant to gain deeper access. Jobs listed at the meeting include car sabotage, political canvassing, artifact theft, and scouting missions — but no hit jobs, confirming the rarity of Red’s note. Olivia speaks with leaders including Cyrus, Rekha (tiefling), and Vector (dwarf), learning George last checked in from Lonnie’s Bar \u0026amp; Grill in Milstrom, en route to a shrine in the mountains. Key Intel # Project Purple Patch appears compromised; Finnegan is on a mission to investigate, meeting someone called Lady Viper. Twilight Company’s hierarchy includes an inner circle; Olivia and Red are identified by name and purpose by members, especially the observant Rekha. Silas eavesdrops on internal discussions, learning about Twilight’s role in manipulating High Forge politics and counterbalancing the Iron Claws. Rekha seems especially astute and potentially suspicious of the group. Next Steps # Travel to Milstrom to follow George’s trail from Lonnie’s. Consider pursuing sabotage missions to support Elspeth’s race effort. Uncover more about Finnegan, the Night Boys, and the true aim of Project Purple Patch. Party Status # Olivia: Acting on church orders, equipped with official writ. Silas: Embedded in Twilight ranks under an alias. Red: Struggling with identity, loss, and implications of divine justice. Next Session: Prepping for the trip to Milstrom, potential infiltration or deeper involvement in Twilight internal affairs.

Foreigners are generally restricted to the Market Ward unless they have paperwork or sponsorship. The Market Ward is full of inns, traders, bars, and entertainment venues—and hosts the city’s underground racing scene.\n🎸 Act I: The Rock Show \u0026amp; Social Hub # Location: A raucous rock venue in the Market Ward. Helisanna has picked up a late-night performance slot. The crowd is small but energetic, and she becomes a local sensation for the night, gathering an impromptu fan club. Bru assists with technical support, tearing down gear and lamenting poor-quality stage setup by the prior act. Silas negotiates a lucrative performance contract with the venue while holding a mysterious briefcase full of gold. 🏁 Act II: Elspeth’s Underground Racing Comeback # Elspeth, a former professional racer, is navigating her return to the underground scene after a controversial disqualification. At the bar, she meets her former associate Thelvult, now sponsored by a major team. She reveals to Thelvult that she believes she was framed for race cheating (overpowering her vehicle), and that her car had been tampered with. Thelvult encourages her to join the upcoming underground race, providing her with contact info for Miss Talks, the punk-rock headhunter managing race entries. Elspeth signs up under the name Team Cooper, aware this might draw attention. 🏎️ Race Structure and Team Roles # The underground race on Sunday is large-scale (rumored 100 participants) and chaotic. Teams typically include:\nRacer Mechanic Spotter Saboteur (to disrupt other teams) Law Influencer (to manipulate legal consequences mid-race) Elspeth contemplates assembling her allies for these roles but hasn’t made formal asks yet. 🧳 Act III: The Briefcase Heist # Silas, Red, and Elspeth leave the club with a briefcase full of gold. Red carries Silas and the case through the city like a bodyguard. They attempt to reach Olivia’s apartment in the residential area, but are stopped by city guards. Visitors need special papers. Silas decides to forge the necessary documents using his charlatan skills, which will take at least an hour. The group detours back to a rented garage, where Elspeth discovers someone has tampered with her race car. 🛠️ Act IV: Investigation and Sabotage # While inspecting her vehicle, Elspeth confirms sabotage—someone who understands car mechanics tried to subtly damage her rig. Olivia joins the garage group early the next morning and sets up coffee and food. A Warforged named Racecar arrives with a cryptic warning: “You should not race. You are being targeted.” Racecar gives a clear description of the saboteur: a short, green-skinned goblin wearing black (turtleneck, gloves, pants). The team now has a suspect. Olivia, suspicious, interrogates Racecar and confirms the sabotage warning is real, but Racecar cannot name the culprit. 🍷 Act V: Helisanna \u0026amp; Bru’s Drunken Adventure # Helisanna and Bru, basking in post-show fame, party hard at the bar. Helisanna handles adoring fans while Bru gets blackout drunk. Bru eventually falls into a pool on the way to the motel and wanders lost before finally finding his room around 7 a.m. Helisanna secures her room with a fraction more dignity. 🔍 Act VI: Olivia’s Side Story – George \u0026amp; Finnegan # Olivia spends her night alone investigating the disappearance of her grand-nephew George. She stops by a local bodega (owned by “Bo Dega”) and chats with a shopkeeper. She learns George was seen with a suspicious halfling named Finnegan—charming, young, blonde, and always around shady people. Back at her apartment, Olivia finds a surprise note on her conspiracy board: “If I go missing, find my lockbox under Olivia Cooper. – George”\nShe adds “Finnegan” to her growing board of suspects and notes to install a security system. ☀️ Act VII: Morning of the Guild Job # As dawn breaks, the garage group wakes to coffee and muffins thanks to Olivia. They prepare for their 6 a.m. meeting with the Steven Guild, who had hired them to protect a caravan. The team shares intel about the upcoming race, Racecar’s warning, and the need to find out who sabotaged Elspeth’s car. Silas warns Red about a local Twilight Company branch operating near the venue—possibly dangerous or relevant to the race. The group now juggles multiple threads: A risky underground race A mysterious goblin saboteur A missing family member A performance tonight And a morning caravan job for the Steven Guild 🎭 Party Dynamics \u0026amp; Emerging Themes # Elspeth: Driven, betrayed racer seeking justice. Silas: Schemer with connections and charm, navigating danger with subtlety. Red: Loyal and strong, but possibly in over his head. Bru: Technical genius and chaos goblin—unpredictable but valuable. Helisanna: Rising star torn between fame and duty. Olivia: Savvy and deeply invested in both family and justice.

Silas – Scheming halfling rogue and manager of the band. Bru – Goblin artificer and chaos gremlin with a flair for pyrotechnics. Red (formerly Blue) – Goliath cleric, pacifist healer, and protector. Olivia – Elderly paladin with a cop-like sense of justice. Elspeth – Artificer gunslinger with a mechanical companion, BoxBox. Opening Scene: Chaos at the Tavern # The party is split between eating dinner and running a shell game when a Goliath barges into the Cog and Steam tavern shouting about “Bartley P. Thatch.” Chaos breaks out:\nA beer stein brains the Goliath. A full-on brawl begins. Bru magically engineers fart-scented peanuts and lobs them into the crowd. Olivia tries to intimidate the crowd but is punched and takes 4 damage. Silas steals 10 silver during the commotion and stealths away. Elspeth tries to back Olivia up with intimidation and BoxBox tackles a brawler. Red nervously assesses the situation and casts Guidance on Olivia. Bru sets off a fireworks cannon that creates fire-show chaos, followed by him throwing chairs and shouting “Fire!” while Kevin runs around screaming. Eventually, the tavern clears out thanks to a fire suppression system and Olivia and Elspeth’s crowd control. They leave the tavern in disarray.

Bru acts as spotter (poorly); Silas uses psychic dice and sleight of hand to win big. They win enough gold to buy burgers and reflect on their sloppy success. 🕶️ Red \u0026amp; Elspeth # Tag along to the Little Hovel to watch over the group. Red awkwardly wallflowers but eventually joins the others near the stage. Elspeth probes for underground racing contacts but doesn’t find much. Concert of the Century # Helisanna headlines the final act at The Little Hovel with support from Bru and Red:\nBru engineers stage pyrotechnics synced to the set. Red uses Thaumaturgy to enhance the flames with purple coloration. Helisanna delivers a transcendent metal performance enhanced by Guidance and Enhance Ability from Red. Audience members’ eyes glow purple, magic fills the air, and a surreal, euphoric concert atmosphere takes over. Performance rolls exceed 24. The show is an unforgettable success. Massive Payday # Silas negotiates a last-minute, high-profile gig with Sandra Talks for 10,000 gold: 1,000 gold up front in a suitcase. 6,000 upon arrival at the show. 3,000 after the show. The group is now flush with resources, contemplating splitting the gold and debating tour logistics (stay in van or book lodging).
