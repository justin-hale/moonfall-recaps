They arrive at a meadery and dining hall where Roscoe cryptically offers to share “all of his secrets” if the party will drink his specially made Everclear: a magically potent potato alcohol distilled to purity. Before they can fully orient themselves, Roscoe sends Red a telepathic message asking, “Do you trust your compatriots?”\nThe message throws Red into confusion. Speaking aloud, he unsettles the group, who believe he may be hearing voices again. Silas connects himself, Red, and Bru into a psychic mind link to investigate further. Red continues to think out loud, and the group debates whether he’s genuinely dimwitted or just unfiltered. This initiates a series of multi-layered conversations—some aloud, some telepathic, some psychic side-chats—that begins to unravel the social trust and mystery around Roscoe’s true nature.\n🧪 The Everclear Test # Roscoe clarifies that the psychic message was from him, but takes great delight in misleading the party. He offers to reveal the truth about Red’s past—but only if they all drink with him. What follows is a half-hour-long peer-pressure sequence in which each party member reluctantly takes shots of Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s Everclear.\nBru demands the alcohol be “brown” and attempts to add dirt. Roscoe fiercely objects to “tainting” his purity. Bru finally drinks the clear liquor and secretly pours dirt into his mouth mid-sip, proudly proclaiming “It was brown in my mouth.” Silas, skeptical and unimpressed, drinks without fanfare and remains steady. Helisanna drinks and holds her own despite the alcohol’s nearly caustic potency. Red, who is canonically not a drinker, is caught in a vortex of social pressure, shame, and curiosity. After being peer pressured from every direction, he drinks—with dirt added mid-sip—and is immediately inebriated but jovial. Elspeth and Olivia offer dry commentary, with Olivia eventually healing Red post-binge with Lesser Restoration. 📖 Red’s True Identity Revealed # Once Red drinks, Roscoe gives him a journal belonging to his mother, Marion Cross. The journal, which Red reads aloud to himself while crying in the tunnels beneath his childhood home, reveals staggering truths:\nRed is adopted, which most of the party already suspected. His real name is Thurnok Skyhammer, and he is a Goliath prince from the Skyhammer clan. His parents were not random pilgrims—they were placed in hiding by the Twilight Company to protect Red from the Eldoran Empire. The Crosses raised him in secret and were likely murdered, not taken by illness as the town claimed. The emotional weight of the journal devastates Red, who is wrestling with revelations about his identity, lineage, and the loss of his adoptive family. He remains in a dissociative daze, eventually retreating into his childhood room—which has been stripped and desecrated by squatters.\n👮 Interrogation of the Intruders # While Red reads and processes his identity crisis, the rest of the party turns their attention to the two interlopers who have taken over his family home: Ophelia (an elven woman) and Doc (an orc male). After incapacitating them in a surprise attack, the party handcuffs the duo, ties them to chairs, and begins an extended interrogation.\nOlivia takes the lead, using her former detective persona to extract truths. Silas summons his psychic daggers and threatens to implant their worst memories in their minds—a dark and unsettling turn that proves effective. The captives reveal that the town has fallen under control of the Milstrom Party, a cult-like communist faction led by a mysterious figure known as Red Lennon. They admit that monthly sacrifices are made at an old druidic shrine in the forest to “keep Red Lennon happy.” Red Lennon\u0026rsquo;s power appears supernatural—capable of cursing the town if not appeased. The shrine is believed to be connected to a portal, and only those with red armbands (like the captives) are allowed to witness the rituals. Once they extract all they can, the party knocks the two out again and—fully in line with their chaotic alignment—throws the captives, still in their chairs, into the Bag of Holding.\n🐺 Attack of the Wolves # The moment of catharsis is shattered by sounds of screaming and chaos outside. Wolves—massive, intelligent, and terrifying—have descended upon the town. Roscoe warns the group with his usual ambiguous flair, but the danger is immediate.\nThe party emerges from the tunnel into the basement of the Common Mug inn, shoving through a barricade to find townsfolk in full panic. Five wolves are actively assaulting townspeople and attempting to break into the inn. In the chaos, Red spots a massive dire wolf dragging a screaming woman (Magnolia Redguard) into the woods.\n⚔️ The Battle in the Streets # The group launches into an intense urban skirmish:\nHelisanna draws her axe (her Pact Weapon) and cleaves wolves down in close combat. Bru unleashes a Thunderwave spell, blasting wolves back and doing significant area damage. Silas uses psychic daggers to devastating effect, using sneak attacks and stealth to outmaneuver foes. Olivia engages with her divine smite and battle axe, applying pressure to the strongest wolves. Elspeth and BoxBox coordinate ranged and melee strikes to great effect, wounding multiple wolves at once. Red uses Balm of Peace and healing magic to keep the party alive while also psychically spiraling from the revelations of his parentage and the sound of Magnolia\u0026rsquo;s screams fading into silence. After the brutal brawl, the wolves retreat—but not before leaving behind wounded townsfolk and a shaken party. Red is left grappling with the knowledge that Magnolia, who supposedly witnessed his parents’ murder, may now be dead or worse.\n🧠 Character Arcs \u0026amp; Emotional Shifts # Red / Thurnok Skyhammer: Moves from naïve foundling to a potentially displaced prince with a traumatic past and dangerous destiny. Roscoe: Grows even more enigmatic. His combination of cryptic wisdom, drunken philosophical waxing, and unsettling honesty keeps the party on edge. He seems deeply invested in Red’s awakening. Silas: Leans further into his morally grey persona, using psychic threats and back-alley tactics for results. He becomes Red’s unspoken guardian as things unravel. Helisanna: Balances chaotic humor with raw power, revealing her musical and magical fury in equal measure. Olivia: Anchors the team with lawful conviction, but begins to blur lines with her intimidating methods. Elspeth: Keeps calm and focused, contributing significantly to the battle and showing her capability as a reliable support and damage dealer. Bru: Continues to play the wildcard—blending bombs, humor, and a taste for destruction while subtly showing care for Red and the group. 🧩 Loose Threads # Magnolia Redguard has been dragged away by wolves. Her fate is unknown. She may be the only person who witnessed Red’s parents\u0026rsquo; death. Willemay, the dissenting voice in town, is still scheduled for execution within a few hours. Red Lennon’s role as both political leader and magical threat has yet to be addressed. The Druidic Shrine—long known to be a place of power—is possibly a portal, a blight source, and the focal point of the cult’s activities. Roscoe’s nature remains suspicious. He may be a warforged Peaceforged soldier, once part of a psychic hive-mind led by a being named SHIELD. 📜 Memorable Quotes # “It was brown in my mouth.” – Bru, after spiking his Everclear with dirt\n“You know, Roscoe, I don’t really drink…” – Red, just before spiraling into identity collapse\n“I am a liar. And I can also be a hypocrite.” – Roscoe\n“You’re giving me mildly autistic vibes in a creepy way.” – Olivia, to Roscoe\n“Roscoe’s Everclear: You Only Live Once.” – Roscoe, marketing his drink\n“Everything about Red’s life is a lie.” – Roscoe\n🏁 Session End # The wolves are driven off. The townspeople cheer the party’s heroism, but the weight of what was uncovered still hangs heavy:\nRed has a new name, a forgotten kingdom, and a lost inheritance. A friend who could shed light on his parents may be dead. A sacrificial cult runs the town. And time is running out before Willemay is executed. The party stands at a crossroads, caught between heroism, revenge, and revolution.\nNext stop: the shrine—and maybe Red Lennon.\n","date":"19 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-11/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party drinks Roscoe’s Everclear and uncovers Red’s royal past while wolves descend on the town","title":"Session Eleven: You Only Live Once","type":"sessions"},{"content":"Look back at session summaries from the entire campaign.\n","date":"19 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/","section":"Sessions","summary":"","title":"Sessions","type":"sessions"},{"content":" ❖ Recap of Previous Events # The party had escaped High Forge and began traveling with a large caravan. They met Eleanor’s Wandering Coven, got introduced to a magic guild, and helped Fred, who now provides them with info. Fred brought them the case of Bori, a boy in a coma due to a deal made with a mysterious entity named Crawley. The party retrieved a fox totem from a shrine after solving a moonlight puzzle and fighting a guardian, then gave it to Crawley. Bori and his family recovered. ❖ Journey Toward Milstrom # The caravan travels along a blighted, eerie landscape toward Milstrom. At a crossroads, the party meets two intimidating Eldoran Knights warning travelers to avoid Milstrom. The knights say the town has changed, hinting at dangerous, mind-affecting forces. The party, citing numerous quests tied to Milstrom, decides to proceed despite warnings. ❖ Context for Milstrom # The group lists their reasons for entering Milstrom:\nA blight affecting Eleanor’s shrine. The mystery surrounding the mayor’s disappearance and rumors of a political collective. The last known location of Finnegan and George (Project Purple Patch). A potential portal to hell. Red\u0026rsquo;s personal ties: family history and suspected involvement of the Twilight Company. Possible show venue for Hellasana at the Common Mug tavern. ❖ Enter: The Food Truck Clubhouse \u0026amp; Party Debate # The party discusses tactics (talking vs. explosions) in their crowded food truck, full of allies and passengers. Political and social topics emerge, including the status of tieflings, who are recent hellspawn refugees, and commentary on racial/species mechanics in D\u0026amp;D. The party debates decision-making processes and considers votes, brute strength, and past combat performance. ❖ Arrival at Milstrom # They talk their way past the Eldoran Knights checkpoint with Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s help, receiving a brooch to report back with findings. The town appears unusually orderly and proud. The forest is blighted, and the townspeople wear red armbands. The Common Mug tavern is the social center. There are no street vendors or signs of a typical free market economy. Tobias the blacksmith mentions a collectivist movement led by someone named Red Linen. ❖ Meet Roscoe # The party meets Roscoe, a bizarre old Warforged with a makeshift digestive system from wish magic. Roscoe, clearly eccentric and alcoholic, offers valuable knowledge in exchange for beer—a lot of it. The party stealthily steals a keg from the tavern while the town holds a public trial. ❖ Show Trial at the Common Mug # The party witnesses a chilling communist-style public tribunal. A woman named Willemay Hargreave is sentenced to execution at dawn for “counter-revolutionary activity.” Her accusations: questioning Red Linen’s regime and warning about creeping authoritarianism. ❖ Tunnels and Revelations # In exchange for the keg, Roscoe reveals: A hidden trapdoor that leads to tunnels beneath Milstrom, used by pilgrims to avoid the town. Directions to the corrupted shrine, detailed via a drunkenly hand-drawn but decipherable map. Information about Willemay’s dissent and religious alignment (devoted to Tyr). Confirmation that the town is under subtle magical corruption stemming from Red Linen—a literal devil from hell. Insights about Olivia\u0026rsquo;s nephew Finnegan and George, who passed through these tunnels in pursuit of a pilgrimage. ❖ The Pilgrim Route and Next Steps # The party uses Roscoe\u0026rsquo;s tunnels and map to plan their approach. They face moral quandaries: Should they intervene in Willemay’s execution? Can they defeat Red Linen and break his corruptive influence on the town? Olivia and Elspeth reflect on familial ties and motivations. Roscoe encourages them to act quickly, warning of Red Linen’s hold on the town’s morality and politics. Notable NPCs Introduced # Roscoe – A drunken Warforged with a self-modified digestive system, deep knowledge of the town, and tragic yet comedic undertones. Tobias – Friendly blacksmith, neutral on politics. Willemay Hargreave – Elven woman and outspoken dissenter sentenced to execution. Red Linen – Devilish communist leader corrupting Milstrom from behind the scenes. Eldoran Knights – Cautious guards stationed outside Milstrom. Key Threads Moving Forward # Investigate and potentially cleanse the shrine causing the blight. Stop Willemay’s execution and uncover more about Red Linen’s control. Use underground tunnels for stealth and recon. Follow leads regarding Finnegan, George, and Project Purple Patch. Maintain faction reputation and balance public-facing actions with the risk of exposure.

After a restful night, a new supernatural mystery involving a comatose child draws the party eastward into the woods and deeper into the realms of fae influence.\nParty Members Present # Helisanna – Human Bard/Warlock Elspeth Cooper – Dwarf Battlesmith Artificer/Paladin Felonias \u0026ldquo;Bru\u0026rdquo; Bru – Goblin Artillerist Artificer Retired Detective Olivia Cooper – Dwarf Devotion Paladin Red – Absent PC played by another player (healer) Silas – Remains asleep, not part of the night’s excursion Plot Events # A Midnight Emergency # Fred the gopher (from previous sessions) bursts into camp seeking Red\u0026rsquo;s healing help. A child in the camp, Bori, has mysteriously fallen into a coma the same night his mother, Sela, awakened from her months-long coma. Olivia, Elspeth, and Red respond, leaving the rest asleep. Grogi, a friend of Bori’s, recounts that the boys met a “weird man in a white suit and top hat” in the woods the day before, who offered to \u0026ldquo;help\u0026rdquo; Bori’s mother in exchange for a trade. Olivia uses Divine Sense and detects a faint trace of evil on Bori but not on his mother. Gathering the Team # Olivia wakes Helisanna and Bru without alerting Silas. Silas remains asleep in the van. The group agrees to investigate the mysterious encounter from the day before. Red’s medical check confirms that healing won’t help Bori—his state is magical in nature. Into the Woods # The Crossroads Encounter # Following Grogi’s directions, the party ventures into the eerie eastern woods under moonlight, accompanied by Red. At a crossroads, they hear humming—“Pop Goes the Weasel”—followed by the poem “The Tyger” by William Blake. A fae named Mr. Crowley appears: white suit, opera mask, pointy teeth, charming yet disturbing. He confirms he struck a deal with Bori, who gave up his own consciousness to save his mother’s life. Crowley offers a new deal: retrieve a fox-shaped fae totem from an ancient shrine in exchange for restoring Bori’s consciousness without reverting Sela back into her coma. Journey to the Shrine # The Midnight Pool # Guided by a magical mote of light Crowley provides, the party finds a hidden shrine in the heart of the woods. They uncover a dry celestial pool surrounded by old mirrors. When moonlight is properly reflected using the mirrors, a hidden staircase opens beneath the pool. Guardian of the Shrine # Within the shrine, they find the totem on a fallen pedestal. As Helisanna approaches, a skeletal bear with ram’s horns and green fire eyes emerges. A battle ensues: Bru and Red\u0026rsquo;s fire spells are particularly effective. Olivia and Boxbox (Elspeth’s steel defender) make a strong defensive duo, using reactions to deflect attacks. Elspeth and Helisanna contribute with ranged and melee attacks. The bear is destroyed after Olivia lands a devastating smite attack. The Decision # Helisanna picks up the totem. Elspeth uses Identify and confirms it’s a powerful conjuration-linked item: a Fae anchor for the spirit known as Tunlak. A ritual could potentially summon Tunlak, but the components are unknown. The group debates whether to give the totem to Crowley, fearing long-term consequences. Ultimately, they choose to honor the deal. Return to Crowley # Crowley appears at the crossroads, genuinely pleased. He accepts the totem and assures them Bori will awaken and he will leave the area in peace. Helisanna shakes his hand, sealing the deal. Crowley vanishes into the earth, leaving only his smile lingering in the air. Epilogue # Back at the refugee camp, the party sees the family joyfully reunited: Bori, Sela, and Turek are all awake and well. Olivia warns Hoboken (the monk of Steyr) to spread word about Crowley and to warn others against making fae bargains. The party ends the night wary but victorious—having saved a child’s life, made a deal with a devilish fae, and unleashed possible consequences for the future. Notable Roleplay Moments # Crowley’s eerie charm and poetic cadence adds gravitas to the fae bargain. Helisanna’s playful yet bold nature shines during her interactions with Crowley and her curiosity around the totem. Olivia’s legalistic, justice-focused objection to fae deals adds moral weight. Elspeth’s utility and coordination with Boxbox make her a tactical powerhouse. Bru’s love of fire causes a few forest fires, humorously downplayed. Red’s support spells and pacifist nature play a quiet but critical role. Themes # Moral ambiguity: Should a deal with a fae be upheld for a good outcome? Innocence and cost: A child’s sacrifice underscores the theme of exploitation. Choices and consequences: The long-term effect of giving Crowley what he wants remains unclear. Session MVP # Crowley – For stealing every scene he was in and ratcheting up the creep factor in the best way possible.\n","date":"5 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-9/","section":"Sessions","summary":"The party enters the woods to break a fae bargain and strikes a dangerous deal with Mr. Crowley.","title":"Session Nine: A Stranger at the Crossroads","type":"sessions"},{"content":" 🚚 Escape from High Forge and Into the Wild # The party finally leaves the deep tunnels under High Forge, emerging into the dawn-lit foothills of the surrounding mountains. As they rejoin a larger caravan of fleeing citizens and merchants, the group maintains a low profile while still accompanied by Bo, the Twilight Company remnants, and the now-painted vehicles: Vroomfall and Zoomfall.\nVan aesthetics update: Vroomfall now features the iconic “Three Steve Moon” (wolves wearing sunglasses) howling at a stylized moon. Zoomfall is painted in a Mad Max–inspired style, waiting on Ellie’s final flair. 🧪 A Wave of Revelations # The session opens with a retrospective on Silas’ backstory:\nSilas and Bru were once part of a gang that stole a powerful artifact from the criminal syndicate The Iron Claws. The stolen item is a glass orb containing a dragon, which is extremely dangerous if mishandled (e.g. stored in a Bag of Holding). The Iron Claws are now actively pursuing Silas by name—meaning his current identity has been compromised. Other shocking reveals include:\nOlivia’s family cat, Bodega, is implicated in drug smuggling—using produce to transport a dangerous eye-drop drug called \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo;. Olivia is devastated to learn her local bodega may have been a front for narcotics. 💰 Loot Recap \u0026amp; Equipment Shopping # The group discusses gold totals:\nEveryone received 2,000g, contributed 666g each for a Bag of Holding, leaving 1,334g remaining per player. Olivia, Elspeth, and others consider what items to buy. Common and uncommon items are approved. Clarifications about heavy armor proficiencies are made, especially with updated 2024 rules. Healing potions are recommended for low-slot clerics. 🌄 Traveling Toward Milstrom # The party travels with the caravan toward Milstrom, Red\u0026rsquo;s hometown.\nBo questions what’s next for him after High Forge. Olivia tries to keep him on the moral path. Silas confesses he\u0026rsquo;s rattled that his “clean” identity was discovered by the Iron Claws. The party confirms the town\u0026rsquo;s name is Milstrom, though it takes a while to recall. 🛑 Paladin Encounter: Religious Persecution # A disturbing road encounter introduces Eldoran paladins—human knights wielding weapons and armor embedded with violaceous crystals (the same material powering Elspeth’s racer).\nThey are forcing refugees to swear allegiance to Empress Eldora, demanding abandonment of their former gods. A knight accosts a dwarven monk who refuses to forsake Tyr. Olivia, Elspeth, and Red intervene—Olivia tries diplomacy, Elspeth supports, and Silas pretends she’s a senile grandma to de-escalate. Silas rolls a 29 deception, diffusing the situation. The monk, named Hoboken, joins the caravan under the party’s protection. ⛺ Campsite Revelations and Side Missions # The caravan stops for the night at a seasonal festival site turned refugee camp. Players pursue side activities:\nHelisanna # Drinks with caravan guards and trades stories about the dragons and Eldoran knights. Learns of another caravan approaching with more paladins a day behind them. Red # Performs triage on injured refugees, healing a severely burned boy using Healing Word. Befriends the boy’s father, Frederick, who insists on repaying the party by joining them and offering his services. Silas # Takes Frederick under his wing, probing him for intelligence. Learns that Project Purple Patch, a mysterious effort related to missing Tyr pilgrims, seems centered around Milstrom. Confirms that Red’s family was likely involved in the coven—raising more mystery around their deaths. Discusses promoting another Hellasana concert to earn gold. Elspeth # Acquires 20 spare car parts from Trevor, a mechanic merchant. Silas negotiates a sponsorship deal for discounted parts in exchange for promoting Trevor’s brand. 🧭 Arrival of Tien \u0026amp; Tiefling Lore Drop # The party meets Tien, their employer from the Steven Guild.\nTien reveals that his entire family are Tiefling refugees from Avernus, having escaped through a rift in the mountains. This is the first canon introduction of Tieflings into the world—players are stunned. The family brought wealth and skills with them, earning a place in society and launching a merchant operation. 📜 Eleanor\u0026rsquo;s Offer: The Blight and the Hearth Seed # The party is approached by Eleanor, a halfling hedge mage from Eleanor’s Wandering Coven:\nShe asks for help taking a Hearth Seed to a Druidic Altar near Milstrom to counteract a mysterious blight affecting the area. She implies that this may be linked to deeper corruption or the nearby hell rift. Red is visibly disturbed—his hometown is falling apart. 📋 The Milstrom To-Do List # The session ends with the party compiling a running list of objectives in Milstrom:\nInvestigate the blight and help restore the Druidic altar. Locate the hell rift and determine its threat. Investigate the disappearance of Mayor Jed Carter. Follow leads on Project Purple Patch and the missing Tyr pilgrims, possibly linked to Red’s family. Figure out the new government structure of Milstrom. Set up a Hellasana concert for funds and influence. Reconnect with Finnegan, a go-between for the Twilight Company. Fred also returns, having located 100 MP3 blanks and assisting with acquiring them for the next concert.\n🌙 Final Thoughts # The party rests under the stars as Bo\u0026rsquo;s caravan and Tien\u0026rsquo;s family merge with their group. Hellasana is drunk, Red is contemplative, Silas is scheming, and Olivia remains ever vigilant. With their next destination looming, Milstrom promises answers—but also deeper mystery and danger.\n","date":"3 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/sessions/session-8/","section":"Sessions","summary":"Tacocats take a moment to meet caravan folks.","title":"Session Eight: Caravan Nights","type":"sessions"},{"content":" Escape From the Race and Into the Fire # The session begins immediately after the conclusion of the race, with the party still in the Vroomfall. Suddenly, explosions are heard from the direction of the Market Ward — possibly indicating a dragon attack. The party, joined by Elspeth who loads her car into the Vroomfall, quickly debates their escape route from the city.\nPlotting a Tunnel Escape # They consider taking the old, secret tunnels beneath the city, once used by royalty and now largely forgotten. Though none of them are experts, Olivia recalls encountering smugglers who may have used the tunnels, and Bru and Silas speculate that their Twilight Company contact Victor may know a way out. However, Little Hovel, where Victor might be, is in the Market Ward — the area currently under siege.\nWith no better options, the party resolves to head toward the chaos to rescue Victor. Olivia also remembers that Bodega, her great-grandson, is at her apartment, which is along the way.\nDriving Into the Market Ward # They begin the drive into the Market Ward against the flow of traffic. Guards at the gate are shocked but let them through. As they enter, they see dragons dive-bombing buildings, fireballs raining down, and a glowing golden magical dome protecting thousands of citizens. Jasper spots golden-armored soldiers forming this protective bubble using connected crystal shields — not High Forge soldiers, possibly Eldoran in origin.\nPicking Up Victor and Bodega # In the chaos, Elspeth is sent to retrieve Bodega separately. The rest of the party drives to Little Hovel, dodging dragon fire via group dexterity saves (blessed and bard-inspired), taking fire damage along the way. They finally find Victor, frantically trying to rescue a mix of essential and ridiculous items — including Girl Scout cookies, a piranha gun, and a folder of old tunnel maps (which he does not realize are valuable).\nVictor is roped into the van and interrogated. He reveals he doesn’t know the tunnels himself but has the folder full of mining routes — potentially useful to navigate out. Olivia grabs it, and the group continues the escape.\nMore Fire, More Problems # Another fireball comes close, prompting another save. Red casts Prayer of Healing to top up the injured party. As they head back toward the gate to exit the Market Ward, one dragon clamps onto it, partially holding it open. The party debates using distractions and illusions to slip by. They attempt a combo: Helisanna casts Minor Illusion of a golden knight while Bru fires his Force Ballista. The illusion nearly works, but the dragon sees through it and retaliates.\nA successful round of saves and creative buffs lets them survive the hit. Red lays on hands to keep people stable. They blast through the gate — just barely making it as the dragon claws into the Great Hall.\nInto the Mines # Inside the now-empty Great Hall, the party heads for the mine entrance. They hear Victor’s sending stone ring and eavesdrop on a call from Twilight Company associate Mira, who informs them the Iron Claws gang is controlling tunnel access and charging fees. Olivia realizes that Helja Ungart, the gang\u0026rsquo;s leader, is an old nemesis who would definitely recognize her — and Silas too, who is now revealed to have stolen a mysterious object from her.\nThe Stolen Orb # Silas produces a swirling, galaxy-filled glass orb, the object of the heist that cost his former crew their lives. Victor calls it a communication device to another plane or being. Olivia touches it — sees a cosmic dragon-like being, and hears it speak her name. She takes psychic damage but learns it knows her deeply.\nThe party debates where to hide the orb, almost placing it in the bag of holding before recalling that could risk catastrophic dimensional collapse. It\u0026rsquo;s safely returned to a regular pack.\nPlans and Disguises # At the aquafarm near the tunnel entrance, they rendezvous with Bodega and the Twilight Company crew (Cyrus, Mira, Lanny, Courtney). The party prepares to sneak past the Iron Claws with a multi-layered plan:\nPaint the Vroomfall to disguise it. Use disguise kits on the more recognizable members. Hide Red and Silas in the bag of holding (without the orb). Hide Helisanna, Elspeth, and Brew in produce crates. During prep, they discover the Twilight Company\u0026rsquo;s crates are full of an illegal drug called \u0026ldquo;V\u0026rdquo; — a red liquid taken as eyedrops. Olivia demands they abandon the cargo or use it as bribe material. Lanny and Courtney reluctantly agree and sink the crates in the hydroponic lake.\nCrossing the Checkpoint # With all disguises prepped, Olivia leads the caravan to the checkpoint, supported by Bo. A tough negotiation ensues with the Iron Claw thugs, who demand 500 gold. Olivia successfully persuades them to accept 450, and the party moves through safely.\nThe Long March and Freedom # They drive for hours through guarded tunnel paths, finally emerging onto the other side of the mountain under a sky of stars. The escape is successful. Victor is overjoyed; Olivia sternly warns Bo this is his one and only pass for getting involved in crime.\nEndgame and Reflections # The party plans to continue toward their next job. Loose ends:\nThe orb is powerful and mysterious — potentially a link to a divine being or dragon. Silas has a bounty on his head and a past with Helja. Olivia’s grandson is still missing, and their journey will lead them closer to that mystery. Red, Helisanna, and Elspeth all have reasons to move forward toward the next city. As the session ends, they prepare to meet their escort at the upcoming rendezvous point, disguises intact, dragon behind them, and dangers still ahead.\nNotable Character Developments:\nOlivia: Uses Lay on Hands, leads negotiations, and interacts with the orb, gaining direct contact with a cosmic dragon. Silas: Revealed to be the target of a major gang due to a heist; hides in the bag of holding. Bru: Leans into criminal connections, provides artillery distraction. Red: Uses key cleric support spells (Bless, Emboldening Bond, Prayer of Healing). Elspeth \u0026amp; Helisanna: Though more in the background, actively involved in crate disguise and navigating escape. New Factions Introduced:\nGolden Knights: Mysterious, Eldoran-associated figures who protect civilians from dragon attacks using a magical shield. Iron Claws: Ruthless gang led by Helja Ungart, charging tolls and locking down the tunnels. Victor: A Despicable Me-inspired Twilight Company techie with comic relief and potential plot utility. Items of Interest:\nThe Orb: A glass sphere linking to a cosmic dragon entity. Piranha Gun: A joke weapon pulled from Victor’s haul. Bag of Holding: Now party-owned, used to hide Silas and Red.

Our heroes seek to escape highforge!","title":"Session Seven: Escape Highforge","type":"sessions"},{"content":" 🎭 Major Events # Olivia\u0026rsquo;s Solo Investigations # Olivia investigates Finnegan\u0026rsquo;s Bakery, finding it suspiciously closed and hastily abandoned. She connects its sudden closure to the disappearance of a local figure and the growing dragon threat. She then visits Bodega, who is also shutting down his shop due to fear of approaching dragons. Olivia arranges for Bodega and his cat to join the group\u0026rsquo;s caravan, securing supplies and shelter. Group Reconvenes Over Breakfast # The group finally gathers and shares scattered info: dragons are real, approaching the city, and causing mass evacuations. This catches several members off guard. There is light-hearted bickering about the concert from the night before and whose actions were most impactful, with multiple characters claiming credit. Tensions briefly rise between Silas and Brew, and Helisanna is teased for her subpar performance. Planning for the Race # The group solidifies roles in the upcoming underground street race: Elspeth will drive the Doomfall. BoxBox (her automaton) rides in the back for support. Silas and Helisanna prepare sabotage and distraction tactics. Brew equips and plans the use of flamethrower cannons and caltrops. Red and Olivia offer support roles including healing, driving, and cannon operation. Tactical positions and sabotage plans are laid out, including: Trapping the narrow tunnel with caltrops (Silas). Stationing Helisanna at a key hairpin turn. Using flamethrower turrets mounted on the van. Olivia staying atop the van as mobile cannon support. Final Pre-Race Errands # Elspeth visits rival racer Divald to exchange small talk and gather intel. Silas collects payment from Twilight Company for prior sabotage work. Brew attempts to steal a communal liquor bottle in a failed scheme to poison rival racers — accidentally disrupting Silas’ own sabotage plan. 🏎️ The Race Begins # Elspeth lines up with nearly 50 racers. The team’s pre-race support is visualized as a surreal, symbolic combat encounter representing “the race” as a sentient monster. Players alternate between skill checks and combat mechanics in a shared narrative framework, effectively “fighting” the dangers of the race. Skill Challenge Highlights: # Silas expertly lays caltrops in the tunnel. Olivia intimidates a goblin team into vacating a key ambush spot. Red casts buffs and support magic like Emboldening Bond. Brew fires fireworks from roof-mounted cannons to detonate landmines. Elspeth benefits from multiple buffs (Cat’s Grace, Sanctuary, Shield of Faith) while dodging traps and maintaining high speed. 💥 Combat with the \u0026ldquo;Race\u0026rdquo; # The “Race” manifests as a mechanical, mobile nightmare that targets Elspeth. The party tactically overwhelms it using positioning, teamwork, and abilities like Hex, Smite, and psychic knives. Olivia lands a decisive hit with Divine Smite. Silas and Helisanna deal significant damage, while Red and Brew offer key support. 🏁 Victory # Elspeth overtakes the final racers using a clever fake-out maneuver and finishes with a jump across the final bridge — Fast \u0026amp; Furious-style. She\u0026rsquo;s awarded first place and a membership into the underground racing circuit.

They’re set to perform for thousands, with a lucrative 10,000 gold contract from their patron, Sandra. But the concert is just one part of the whirlwind — the illegal street race looms the next day.\nParty Preparations: # Helisana chills, channeling her inner rock star and preparing mentally for the concert. Elspeth inspects the car and the van, setting traps and preparing “BoxBox” (her steel defender) to watch the garage. She also builds a tripwire shotgun trap with an alarm spell for added security. Felonias Bru designs and installs two under-the-table pyro-cannons on either side of the concert stage — dual-purpose as fireworks and defense weapons. Total cost: 500 gold. Silas buys MP3-like “magic stones” to record the concert, investing in a recording kit and planning to resell the exclusive concert audio for profit. Red meditates, reflects, and prepares as a moral compass and on-site medic, with water-based crowd cooling ready. Olivia stays back at the garage with BoxBox, overseeing security and routine tasks. 🛠️ The Venue: Forge Heart # The Forge Heart is a legendary and archaic magma-forged anvil temple turned venue. It’s largely symbolic, with lava tubes and cavernous acoustics. The party outfits it with:\nFlame turrets Sound setups Recording systems (assembled by Elspeth) Firework launchers 🧃 Merchandising \u0026amp; Morality # Silas, ever the entrepreneur, plans to sell limited edition live recordings for 10–50 gold each. He schemes exclusivity and nostalgia-based marketing, channeling his rogue instincts into music distribution. Bru mocks the financial priorities, but secretly admires the hustle.\n💣 The Attack at the Show # Just before the show starts, Elspeth spots three suspicious dwarf-sized individuals approaching Silas and Sandra (who is delivering the first 6,000g payment). Combat erupts.\nElspeth blocks the goons and gets grappled. Silas evades capture, gets stabbed, then non-lethally incapacitates one attacker with a psychic knife. Red supports with Sanctuary and Emboldening Bond. Bru launches a mortar firework from the turrets, seriously injuring a goon. Sandra is nearly robbed of the briefcase but escapes. The party captures and incapacitates all three assailants before the show even starts. Suspiciously, the goons were after Silas — not the money. 🎶 The Concert: Chaos \u0026amp; Chords # The concert is chaotic but powerful:\nStart: Initial performance is lackluster (low roll), crowd grows impatient. Middle: Bru launches massive pyrotechnics to save the vibe. Red blesses Helisana with Enhance Ability. Crowd enthusiasm grows. Finale: Glowing-eyed crowd members join the stage as backup bandmates (possibly under infernal influence). Helisana rises via harness with firework “wings,” smoke blankets the stage. Epic finale saves the night. Despite Helisana’s middling rolls, the crowd is riveted by the violence, fireworks, and demonic vibes. 🔫 Surprise Ambush #2 # As the concert ends:\nFour more enemies try to assassinate Silas during the show’s final act. A second battle erupts live on stage. Silas gets shot but evades and retaliates from the crowd. Elspeth and Red join the fight, coordinating spiritual and physical takedowns. One assassin flees as Silas fails a final shot, despite clever positioning. 💰 Post-Concert Payoff # Silas successfully sells nearly all of his MP3s for 50 gold each, netting 5,000 gold. Sandra returns with the final 3,000 gold in a heavy briefcase — but not before criticizing the lack of security. The group realizes (too late) that they were supposed to run the venue themselves. Elspeth’s garage alarm goes off. 🚨 The Garage: Another Intrusion # Silas and Elspeth race back in a taxi, discovering:\nThe alarm was triggered. Two human “tracksuited” would-be saboteurs — a brother-sister duo — are found unconscious at the garage. Elspeth’s traps and alarm successfully fended them off. The duo admits they were hired to sabotage race competitors. 🍻 Denouement # The group splits: Red and Helisana go out drinking with Bru. Silas and Elspeth secure the garage. A mysterious cloaked figure approaches Brew and Red, asking for Silas. Red lies convincingly and they vanish. The crew tallies their haul: nearly 14,250 gold, an unusual amount for such a young party. 🔍 Session Highlights # 🎤 Helisana’s evolving rock-star mystique continues to grow despite middling rolls. 💼 Silas leans deep into capitalism and espionage. 🔧 Elspeth builds, traps, and throws herself into the race prep. 🔥 Bru’s fireworks absolutely saved the concert. 🛡️ Red shines as the protector and moral center — full support mode. 🧩 Threads \u0026amp; Loose Ends # The attackers seemed to know about the payment and targeted Silas specifically. Fans with glowing purple eyes may be linked to infernal or Twilight Company activity. The mystery figure looking for Silas adds more danger to his growing notoriety. Olivia and BoxBox continue to be crucial off-screen characters. The tracksuit twins might reappear.

Party Members Present # Silas Red Hellasana Bru (later) Olivia (temporarily NPC\u0026rsquo;d) Philbin (gnome NPC, captured and interrogated) Key Events # 1. Briefing at the Diner # Silas fills the team in on sabotage plans targeting Elspeth’s car. Twilight Company wants them to sabotage rival cars in Bay 10 and Bay 12. After paying for a meal and some banter with a chameleon-accented waitress, the group heads to the garage. 2. Surprise in the Van # Upon checking the garage and Elspeth’s bay, the party hears noises in their van. They discover three gnomes inside assembling a bomb. Combat breaks out: two gnomes are killed (via Eldritch Blast and melee), one is stabilized and captured. 3. Interrogating Philbin # Philbin reveals they were hired anonymously at \u0026ldquo;Arby’s\u0026rdquo; to sabotage the party’s car. He claims ignorance of the benefactor\u0026rsquo;s identity, describing them only as hooded and threatening. 4. Resurrecting the Gnomes # Red escorts the injured gnomes to a Temple of Tyr. An old cleric revives them. The party coerces the gnomes to finish the bomb and repurpose it to sabotage Bay 10’s car. 5. Sabotage Missions # Bay 10: Silas plants the finished bomb under a racecar while Hellasana distracts guards with a dramatic act. Bay 12: Silas and Bru sneak in. Bru welds the exhaust closed using artificer tools and spells. Silas stalls a suspicious dwarf with flirtation and misdirection. 6. Aftermath and Arby’s Recon # The group reconvenes. Bru is stationed to guard Elspeth’s car. The rest investigate Arby’s for leads on the mysterious saboteur. Interrogation of the front desk and Dirk yields no concrete info. Plan to use Minor Illusion to bait a reaction from suspects is discussed but not executed. Memorable Moments # “Castle Doctrine” humorously invoked to justify murder in their own garage. Philbin’s whining becomes a running gag. Silas’ seduction attempt of a dwarf is absurdly effective. Bru’s sabotage using artificer ingenuity. Arby’s as a hub for underground dealings—ironic given its mundane facade. Ongoing Threads # Mystery of the benefactor behind the gnome saboteurs. Who is trying to sabotage Elspeth? Is it connected to the Twilight Company? The Briefcase: Mentioned to be with Olivia; possibly a future plot thread. Arby’s stakeout: The group may continue to investigate there. Closing # Episode ends with a successful dual sabotage and a vague lead at Arby’s. The crew is exhausted, suspicious, and mildly traumatized but victorious.

Inside, she finds a set of color-coded journals authored by her grandson George, who was last known to be working with the Twilight Company. George’s notes detail a mysterious operation called Project Purple Patch, feuds among High Forge’s underground gangs, and a religious mission involving Father Jacob and Mother Asuka. George was last seen heading north on a pilgrimage tied to the Church of Tyr. Olivia finds a lead in the journals pointing toward a halfling named Finnegan, an information broker who has interfaced with both Twilight Company and the gang Iron Claws. Reuniting the Crew # Silas, Red, and Olivia reconvene at a garage after a period of scattered rest. The party shares updates: Red reveals a Twilight Company hit order against “Healing Touch” — his parents — marked with a certified stamp. Silas confirms the order looks official, despite the Twilight Company not typically engaging in contract killings. The group decides to dig deeper into the Twilight Company’s network and determine how and why Red’s parents were targeted. A Trip to the Cathedral # The trio visits the Cathedral of Tyr, which doubles as a courthouse and jail. Red grapples with the revelation that his pacifist beliefs may have been sheltered from the harsher doctrines of Tyr’s justice. Olivia secures a sealed letter of authority from the bishop, sanctioning her to investigate George’s disappearance on the Church\u0026rsquo;s behalf. The Twilight Company Meeting # The group attends an open Twilight Company meeting held under a bar called the Little Hobble. Silas, under the alias Martin Birchwood, marks himself as a member using Thieves’ Cant to gain deeper access. Jobs listed at the meeting include car sabotage, political canvassing, artifact theft, and scouting missions — but no hit jobs, confirming the rarity of Red’s note. Olivia speaks with leaders including Cyrus, Rekha (tiefling), and Vector (dwarf), learning George last checked in from Lonnie’s Bar \u0026amp; Grill in Milstrom, en route to a shrine in the mountains. Key Intel # Project Purple Patch appears compromised; Finnegan is on a mission to investigate, meeting someone called Lady Viper. Twilight Company’s hierarchy includes an inner circle; Olivia and Red are identified by name and purpose by members, especially the observant Rekha. Silas eavesdrops on internal discussions, learning about Twilight’s role in manipulating High Forge politics and counterbalancing the Iron Claws. Rekha seems especially astute and potentially suspicious of the group. Next Steps # Travel to Milstrom to follow George’s trail from Lonnie’s. Consider pursuing sabotage missions to support Elspeth’s race effort. Uncover more about Finnegan, the Night Boys, and the true aim of Project Purple Patch. Party Status # Olivia: Acting on church orders, equipped with official writ. Silas: Embedded in Twilight ranks under an alias. Red: Struggling with identity, loss, and implications of divine justice. Next Session: Prepping for the trip to Milstrom, potential infiltration or deeper involvement in Twilight internal affairs.

Foreigners are generally restricted to the Market Ward unless they have paperwork or sponsorship. The Market Ward is full of inns, traders, bars, and entertainment venues—and hosts the city’s underground racing scene.\n🎸 Act I: The Rock Show \u0026amp; Social Hub # Location: A raucous rock venue in the Market Ward. Hellasana has picked up a late-night performance slot. The crowd is small but energetic, and she becomes a local sensation for the night, gathering an impromptu fan club. Bru assists with technical support, tearing down gear and lamenting poor-quality stage setup by the prior act. Silas negotiates a lucrative performance contract with the venue while holding a mysterious briefcase full of gold. 🏁 Act II: Elspeth’s Underground Racing Comeback # Elspeth, a former professional racer, is navigating her return to the underground scene after a controversial disqualification. At the bar, she meets her former associate Thelvult, now sponsored by a major team. She reveals to Thelvult that she believes she was framed for race cheating (overpowering her vehicle), and that her car had been tampered with. Thelvult encourages her to join the upcoming underground race, providing her with contact info for Miss Talks, the punk-rock headhunter managing race entries. Elspeth signs up under the name Team Cooper, aware this might draw attention. 🏎️ Race Structure and Team Roles # The underground race on Sunday is large-scale (rumored 100 participants) and chaotic. Teams typically include:\nRacer Mechanic Spotter Saboteur (to disrupt other teams) Law Influencer (to manipulate legal consequences mid-race) Elspeth contemplates assembling her allies for these roles but hasn’t made formal asks yet. 🧳 Act III: The Briefcase Heist # Silas, Red, and Elspeth leave the club with a briefcase full of gold. Red carries Silas and the case through the city like a bodyguard. They attempt to reach Olivia’s apartment in the residential area, but are stopped by city guards. Visitors need special papers. Silas decides to forge the necessary documents using his charlatan skills, which will take at least an hour. The group detours back to a rented garage, where Elspeth discovers someone has tampered with her race car. 🛠️ Act IV: Investigation and Sabotage # While inspecting her vehicle, Elspeth confirms sabotage—someone who understands car mechanics tried to subtly damage her rig. Olivia joins the garage group early the next morning and sets up coffee and food. A Warforged named Racecar arrives with a cryptic warning: “You should not race. You are being targeted.” Racecar gives a clear description of the saboteur: a short, green-skinned goblin wearing black (turtleneck, gloves, pants). The team now has a suspect. Olivia, suspicious, interrogates Racecar and confirms the sabotage warning is real, but Racecar cannot name the culprit. 🍷 Act V: Hellasana \u0026amp; Bru’s Drunken Adventure # Hellasana and Bru, basking in post-show fame, party hard at the bar. Hellasana handles adoring fans while Bru gets blackout drunk. Bru eventually falls into a pool on the way to the motel and wanders lost before finally finding his room around 7 a.m. Hellasana secures her room with a fraction more dignity. 🔍 Act VI: Olivia’s Side Story – George \u0026amp; Finnegan # Olivia spends her night alone investigating the disappearance of her grand-nephew George. She stops by a local bodega (owned by “Bo Dega”) and chats with a shopkeeper. She learns George was seen with a suspicious halfling named Finnegan—charming, young, blonde, and always around shady people. Back at her apartment, Olivia finds a surprise note on her conspiracy board: “If I go missing, find my lockbox under Olivia Cooper. – George”\nShe adds “Finnegan” to her growing board of suspects and notes to install a security system. ☀️ Act VII: Morning of the Guild Job # As dawn breaks, the garage group wakes to coffee and muffins thanks to Olivia. They prepare for their 6 a.m. meeting with the Steven Guild, who had hired them to protect a caravan. The team shares intel about the upcoming race, Racecar’s warning, and the need to find out who sabotaged Elspeth’s car. Silas warns Red about a local Twilight Company branch operating near the venue—possibly dangerous or relevant to the race. The group now juggles multiple threads: A risky underground race A mysterious goblin saboteur A missing family member A performance tonight And a morning caravan job for the Steven Guild 🎭 Party Dynamics \u0026amp; Emerging Themes # Elspeth: Driven, betrayed racer seeking justice. Silas: Schemer with connections and charm, navigating danger with subtlety. Red: Loyal and strong, but possibly in over his head. Bru: Technical genius and chaos goblin—unpredictable but valuable. Hellasana: Rising star torn between fame and duty. Olivia: Savvy and deeply invested in both family and justice.

Silas – Scheming halfling rogue and manager of the band. Bru – Goblin artificer and chaos gremlin with a flair for pyrotechnics. Red (formerly Blue) – Goliath cleric, pacifist healer, and protector. Olivia – Elderly paladin with a cop-like sense of justice. Elspeth – Artificer gunslinger with a mechanical companion, BoxBox. Opening Scene: Chaos at the Tavern # The party is split between eating dinner and running a shell game when a Goliath barges into the Cog and Steam tavern shouting about “Bartley P. Thatch.” Chaos breaks out:\nA beer stein brains the Goliath. A full-on brawl begins. Bru magically engineers fart-scented peanuts and lobs them into the crowd. Olivia tries to intimidate the crowd but is punched and takes 4 damage. Silas steals 10 silver during the commotion and stealths away. Elspeth tries to back Olivia up with intimidation and BoxBox tackles a brawler. Red nervously assesses the situation and casts Guidance on Olivia. Bru sets off a fireworks cannon that creates fire-show chaos, followed by him throwing chairs and shouting “Fire!” while Kevin runs around screaming. Eventually, the tavern clears out thanks to a fire suppression system and Olivia and Elspeth’s crowd control. They leave the tavern in disarray. Post-Brawl: Recruitment Offer # Outside, a figure named Dirk from the Stephen Guild offers the party a job:\nGuard a caravan along the Gold Road to Eldoran. 500 gold for the job. Meeting time: 6 AM at the Garages Café near the caravan bays. The group is noncommittal and skeptical about the rate. Evening Activities # The party splits up:\n🎸 Hellasana # Investigates The Little Hovel, a dive metal club. Signs up to perform a set at 1 AM after scoping out terrible opening acts. Gains the attention of Sandra Talks, a sharply dressed talent agent scouting for a show. 🎲 Silas \u0026amp; Bru # Run a card cheating scam on local gamblers. Bru acts as spotter (poorly); Silas uses psychic dice and sleight of hand to win big. They win enough gold to buy burgers and reflect on their sloppy success. 🕶️ Red \u0026amp; Elspeth # Tag along to the Little Hovel to watch over the group. Red awkwardly wallflowers but eventually joins the others near the stage. Elspeth probes for underground racing contacts but doesn’t find much. Concert of the Century # Hellasana headlines the final act at The Little Hovel with support from Bru and Red:\nBru engineers stage pyrotechnics synced to the set. Red uses Thaumaturgy to enhance the flames with purple coloration. Hellasana delivers a transcendent metal performance enhanced by Guidance and Enhance Ability from Red. Audience members’ eyes glow purple, magic fills the air, and a surreal, euphoric concert atmosphere takes over. Performance rolls exceed 24. The show is an unforgettable success. Massive Payday # Silas negotiates a last-minute, high-profile gig with Sandra Talks for 10,000 gold: 1,000 gold up front in a suitcase. 6,000 upon arrival at the show. 3,000 after the show. The group is now flush with resources, contemplating splitting the gold and debating tour logistics (stay in van or book lodging). Cliffhanger \u0026amp; Next Steps # The group has conflicting commitments: a 6 AM meeting with Dirk and a high-paying concert the next night. They are now recognized as elite talent and might have choices to make between fame and duty.
