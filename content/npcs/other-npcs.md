# Notable NPCs - Supporting Cast

## 1. **Jasper Gaines** *(Session 18)*
**Human Barbarian | Gaines Brewery Bakery and Bankery**
The latest addition to the party, arriving during the Winter Solstice celebration. A berserker warrior wearing dulled Eldoran armor who proved his worth by helping defeat Negacast. Connected to Roscoe through friendship and owns VIP tickets to his family's business in Eldora. Has successfully integrated into the group's chaotic dynamic.

## 2. **Father Jacob** *(Session 15)*
**Tyr Pilgrim Leader | Project Purple Patch**
Led the group of Tyr pilgrims investigating the corrupted shrine on Grimvar's Spine. Cranky coffee-dependent priest who became trapped in the Shadowfell until the party's rescue.

## 3. **Frankie the Werewolf** *(Session 12)*
**Pack Leader turned Ally | Wilderness Guide**
Originally attacked Milstrom as an alpha werewolf driven by hunger caused by demonic corruption in the forest. Negotiated alliance with the party through Silas's telepathic communication. Fought alongside them against devils at the corrupted shrine before being cured of his lycanthropy by Eleanor. Represented the possibility of turning enemies into allies through understanding.

## 4. **Sandra Talks** *(Session 1)*
**Talent Agent | Entertainment Industry**
Sharp-dressed talent scout who offered Hellasana the massive 10,000 gold concert contract that launched their fame. Appeared at The Little Hovel during their breakout performance and recognized their potential immediately. Her contracts came with security expectations the party failed to fully understand, leading to criticism about venue management.

## 5. **Caspian (Winter King's Assistant)** *(Session 18)*
**Water Genasi | Seasonal Magic Specialist**
The real Winter King's assistant who appeared to save the Winter Solstice celebration after defeating the evil Negacast impostor. Properly dressed for winter weather (unlike the impostor) and wielded powerful ice magic to restore the corrupted festivities. Captured by Crowley in a dramatic cliffhanger, suggesting larger supernatural threats.

## 6. **Jeremy/Jeffrey the Shepherd** *(Session 14)*
**Former Vampire Hunter | Magical Sheep Rancher**
Struggling shepherd trying to manage six magical sheep with minds of their own. Previously worked in vampire hunting until his "enemy" destroyed his last job. Provided the party with Woolen Cloaks of the Mountain Guardians after they helped corral his escaped livestock. His sheep included lightning-shooting Bessie, cliff-climbing Gus, and the prophetic Old Myrtle.

## 7. **Tien** *(Session 8)*
**Tiefling Merchant | Steven Guild**
First canonical Tiefling introduced to the campaign world, representing refugees from Avernus who escaped through a mountain rift. His entire family are Tiefling refugees who brought wealth and skills from their infernal homeland. Hired the party for caravan protection and paid 200 gold for them to wait in Milstrom during their detour.

## 8. **Magnolia Redguard** *(Session 11-13)*
**Halfling Witness | Tea Enthusiast**
Elderly woman who witnessed Zeke leaving Red's parents' house on the night of their murder. Her reliability as a witness is questionable due to regular consumption of mildly psychoactive tea that affects memory. Lives in a cottage filled with quilted furniture and provided crucial testimony about the argument between Zeke and the Cross family.

## 9. **Dirk** *(Session 1)*
**Steven Guild Representative | Caravan Coordinator**
Offered the party their first major job - guarding a caravan along the Gold Road to Eldoran for 500 gold. Met them outside the Cog and Steam tavern after the opening brawl, though the group was initially noncommittal about the rate.

## 10. **Racecar the Warforged** *(Session 2)*
**Underground Racing Informant | Cryptic Warner**
Appeared at Elspeth's garage with the warning "You should not race. You are being targeted." Provided crucial intelligence about the saboteur: a short, green-skinned goblin wearing all black. His information helped the party identify the threat against Elspeth's racing career and prepare appropriate countermeasures.

## 11. **Red Lennon/Red Lennon** *(Session 10)*
**Devil | Communist Revolutionary Leader**
The literal devil who took control of Milstrom through a corrupted communist political movement. Demanded monthly sacrifices at the druidic shrine and maintained supernatural control over the town's population. His influence created the oppressive political atmosphere that led to show trials and executions of dissidents like Willemay Hargreave.

## 12. **Willemay Hargreave** *(Session 10)*
**Elven Dissident | Counter-Revolutionary**
Sentenced to execution for questioning Red Lennon's regime and warning about creeping authoritarianism. Her public trial at the Common Mug demonstrated the town's descent into totalitarian control. Devoted to Tyr and represented the last voices of opposition before the party's intervention broke the devil's hold on Milstrom.

## 13. **Bodega/Bo** *(Session 8)*
**Shopkeeper | Reluctant Criminal**
Olivia's local bodega owner who was revealed to be involved in drug smuggling, using produce to transport "V" (a dangerous eye-drop drug).

## 14. **Thelvult** *(Session 2)*
**Professional Racer | Elspeth's Former Associate**
Sponsored racer who encouraged Elspeth to return to underground racing despite her controversial disqualification. Provided contact information for Miss Talks and confirmed that Elspeth believed she was framed for race cheating. Represents connections to Elspeth's past career and ongoing racing subplot.

## 15. **Old Myrtle** *(Session 14)*
**Prophetic Sheep | Divine Oracle**
Jeremy's most unusual sheep, possessed by the spirit of a god and capable of speech. Provided cryptic warnings about recent pilgrims being "lost between worlds" and the shadow realm weakening. Disintegrated into bones and wool upon returning to the cottage, immediately replaced by a "more perfect" offspring of Bob and Bessie.

## 16. **Hoboken** *(Session 8)*
**Dwarven Monk | Tyr Faithful**
Monk of Tyr who refused to forsake his god when confronted by Eldoran paladins forcing religious conversion. Protected by the party's diplomatic intervention (particularly Silas's deception about Olivia being a senile grandma). Joined their caravan under party protection, representing religious persecution by the Empire.

## 17. **Helja Ungart** *(Session 7)*
**Iron Claws Gang Leader | Criminal Mastiff**
Leader of the ruthless Iron Claws gang who controls tunnel access and charges tolls during emergencies.

Represents ongoing criminal threats and personal vendettas.

## 18. **Finnegan** *(Session 2-3)*
**Information Broker | Twilight Company Operative**
Mentioned throughout early sessions as George's mentor and contact, teaching him cocktail making and lockpicking.
