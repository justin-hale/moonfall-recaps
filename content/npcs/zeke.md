# Zeke

## Basic Information
- **Race**: Unknown (presumably human)
- **Allegiance**: Eldoran Empire (spy)
- **Location**: Last known heading toward Eldora
- **Occupation**: Imperial spy, assassin
- **First Mentioned**: Session 11 - "You Only Live Once"
- **Revealed as Murderer**: Session 13 - "Burning down the house"

## Background
Zeke operated as a deep-cover Eldoran spy in Milstrom, maintaining the facade of a local resident while conducting intelligence operations for the Empire. His primary mission appeared to involve monitoring the hidden Goliath prince (Red/Thurnok Skyhammer) and tracking Goliath clan movements in the surrounding mountains.

## The Murder of Red's Parents
Zeke is responsible for the deaths of Marion and Robert Cross, Red's adoptive parents:

### The Method
- **Poison**: Deliberately contaminated the well water at the Cross family home
- **Cover-up**: Made the deaths appear to be from natural illness rather than murder
- **Timing**: Killed them after they discovered his true identity and threatened to expose him

### The Motive
According to witness testimony from Magnolia:
- Zeke had an argument with Red's parents on the night they died
- After he left, they discussed how "Zeke knows too much" 
- They planned to "take care of him," suggesting they intended to expose or eliminate the spy
- Zeke likely returned to silence them before they could act

## Evidence from Zeke's Journal
The party recovered Zeke's personal journal from his cottage, which revealed:
- **Imperial Mission**: Detailed records of his spying activities for the Eldoran Empire
- **Surveillance Operations**: Extensive monitoring of Red and Goliath clan activities
- **Murder Confirmation**: Documentation of poisoning the well water
- **Escape Plans**: Recent entries showing preparation to flee Milstrom
- **Intelligence Reports**: Information about Goliath movements and potential resistance activities

## Current Status
- **Fugitive**: Fled Milstrom ahead of the party's investigation
- **Destination**: Tracked heading toward Eldora, likely to report to Imperial handlers
- **Evidence**: Left behind purple magical traces that the party attempted to follow
- **Transportation**: Escaped on horseback with additional riders, suggesting Imperial support

## Threat Level
Zeke represents a significant ongoing threat because:
- **Imperial Knowledge**: Possesses detailed intelligence about Red's true identity
- **Strategic Information**: Knows about Goliath clan locations and activities  
- **Escape Success**: Has successfully returned to Imperial territory with sensitive intelligence
- **Potential Return**: May lead future Imperial operations against the mountain clans

## Investigation Timeline
1. **Initial Suspicion**: Magnolia identified Zeke as present during the murders
2. **Cottage Investigation**: Party discovered his journal and evidence
3. **Accidental Destruction**: The cottage burned down during the investigation, destroying additional evidence
4. **Pursuit Attempt**: Party tracked his escape route but arrived too late to intercept

## Relationships
- **Marion and Robert Cross**: His murder victims, Red's adoptive parents
- **Red/Thurnok**: Primary surveillance target, unaware of Zeke's true identity
- **Eldoran Empire**: His true masters and handlers
- **Magnolia**: Witness to his presence during the murders (though unreliable due to drug use)

## Campaign Significance
Zeke's revelation as the murderer of Red's parents represents a major turning point in Red's character development and provides a direct personal connection to the broader conflict with the Eldoran Empire. His escape with crucial intelligence about the Skyhammer bloodline potentially compromises the safety of Red's entire clan.

## Unresolved Threats
- May provide intelligence for future Imperial attacks on Goliath settlements
- Could expose Red's location and identity to Imperial forces
- Represents the Empire's deep infiltration capabilities in remote communities
- His knowledge of local resistance activities threatens Twilight Company operations

## Justice Pending
The party has sworn to pursue justice for Red's parents' murder, making Zeke a priority target for future missions. His crimes against the Cross family have made this conflict deeply personal for the entire party.
