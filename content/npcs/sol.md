# Sol

## Basic Information
- **Race**: Dragon (Star-touched/Cosmic)
- **Role**: Guardian of the Worms Tunnel trials, Portal guardian
- **Location**: The constellation chamber within Grimvar's Spine
- **First Appearance**: Session 20 - "Trials of the W****M Hole"

## Physical Description

### Dragon Form
Sol is a magnificent dragon of enormous size whose body initially appeared to be architectural beams coiled throughout the constellation chamber. His most striking feature is his scales that radiate starlight like shards of the night sky, creating a dappled, celestial glow throughout any space he occupies.

### Humanoid Form
Sol can shapeshift into the form of an elderly, hunchbacked Goliath wearing raggedy clothes and carrying a cane. Despite the dramatic physical transformation, he maintains the same distinctive voice. He playfully insists he is "a different person" when in this form, though the deception is obvious to observers.

## Abilities and Powers

### Magical Capabilities
- **Shapeshifting**: Can transform between dragon and Goliath forms at will
- **Portal Control**: Guards and controls access to the astral tree portal network
- **Celestial Connection**: His starlight scales suggest deep connections to cosmic forces
- **Ancient Wisdom**: Possesses knowledge of the Skyhammer bloodline and royal trials

### Guardian Duties
- **Trial Oversight**: Administers the riddle test for those seeking to undergo royal trials
- **Portal Gateway**: Controls access to the astral tree's interdimensional network
- **Bloodline Verification**: Can recognize and test legitimate Skyhammer royalty
- **Protective Force**: Physically capable of forcing travelers through portals when necessary

## Role in the Trials

### The Riddle Test
Sol challenges those seeking the trials with the question: "What burns in your heart?" This test appears to evaluate the moral character and motivations of potential candidates rather than testing knowledge or cleverness.

### Red's Trial
When Red answered that his greatest desire was to protect and care for other people, preventing them from coming to harm, Sol approved of this response and allowed the party to proceed to the astral tree.

### The Ancestral Gift
Before beginning the descent through the astral tree, Sol presented Red with a tomahawk - described as a gift from his parents and part of his heritage as a Skyhammer royal. This suggests Sol has connections to Red's family history and the royal bloodline.

## The Astral Tree Portal

### Portal Network Guardian
Sol oversees access to a massive tree surrounded by a star-speckled forest that serves as a cosmic hub connecting many worlds across the universe. The portal appears as a perfect black void darker than anything imaginable, leading to this interdimensional nexus.

### Forced Transportation
Despite the party's concerns about being able to return, Sol assured them they could come back once Red proved himself worthy. When they hesitated, he used his tail to forcefully sweep the entire party through the portal, demonstrating both his physical power and his commitment to the trial process.

## Personality and Behavior

### Ancient Wisdom
Sol demonstrates the patience and knowledge of an ancient being who has overseen these trials for generations. His calm assurance about the portal's safety suggests extensive experience with interdimensional travel.

### Playful Deception
His obvious shapeshifting into a Goliath form while insisting he's "a different person" shows a playful, almost mischievous personality despite his serious role as guardian.

### Protective Authority
While generally benevolent, Sol doesn't hesitate to use force when necessary to ensure the trials proceed properly. His sweep of the party through the portal demonstrates he has the authority and power to compel compliance with the trial requirements.

## Connection to Skyhammer Heritage

### Family Knowledge
Sol's presentation of the tomahawk as a gift from Red's parents indicates he has direct knowledge of the Skyhammer royal family and their history. This suggests he may have known Red's birth parents personally.

### Bloodline Recognition
His ability to recognize Red's legitimacy and administer the appropriate trials implies Sol has long-standing connections to the Skyhammer clan and their royal traditions.

### Ancient Pact
Sol's role as guardian suggests an ancient agreement or magical binding that designates him as the overseer of royal trials, possibly dating back generations of Skyhammer rulers.

## Campaign Significance

### Gateway Function
Sol serves as the crucial gateway between the material world and the cosmic trials that will determine Red's royal destiny. His approval was necessary for the party to access the next phase of their quest.

### Wisdom and Guidance
Beyond his role as guardian, Sol provides guidance and ancestral gifts that suggest he serves as a bridge between Red's lost family heritage and his future potential as a Skyhammer royal.

### Cosmic Connections
His star-touched nature and role in the interdimensional portal network suggest Sol represents connections to cosmic forces that may become important in the broader conflict against Eldoran space-based supremacy.

## Future Implications
- **Return Journey**: The party may need to return through Sol's portal after completing the trials
- **Ongoing Guidance**: Sol may provide additional support or wisdom as Red develops his royal abilities
- **Cosmic Alliance**: His connections to stellar forces could prove valuable in space-based conflicts
- **Family Secrets**: He may possess additional knowledge about Red's heritage and the Skyhammer bloodline's cosmic significance
