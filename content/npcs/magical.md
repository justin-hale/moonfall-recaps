## Conclusion

The magical and otherworldly beings throughout the campaign represent the cosmic scale of threats and wonders that exist beyond normal reality. From time-manipulating chronomancers trapped by their own hubris to divine entities fighting cosmic wars for universal control, these entities demonstrate that the party's adventures have implications far beyond local concerns.

These supernatural beings serve various roles: some provide crucial guidance and support (oracles, angels, environmental spirits), others represent cautionary tales about the dangers of unchecked magical power (Marcus, Scarlet, Matthew), and still others fight cosmic-level conflicts that determine the fate of entire realities (Velz'eth, Luminar, divine networks).

Their presence in the campaign emphasizes themes of balance versus order, the responsibility that comes with power, the importance of mercy and redemption, and the need for heroes who can operate on both local and cosmic scales. Whether serving as allies, sources of wisdom, or examples of supernatural consequences, these entities provide the mythic backdrop that elevates the party's adventures from local heroism to universal significance.
