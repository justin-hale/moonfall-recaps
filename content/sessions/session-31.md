## Pre-Session Banter

The session opens with an extended discussion about corporate sponsorships, with several party members mysteriously sporting branded clothing from Ford, Coca-Cola, and other major corporations. This leads to a running gag about F-150 features and Coca-Cola throughout the episode, much to Justin's dismay.

## The Post-Heist Celebration

Fresh from their successful vault heist, the party engages in their post-heist ritual involving Bru's homemade moonshine. Despite some hesitation from the more law-abiding party members about the legality of the liquor, the tradition continues. During their escape from the city, they encounter guards who are easily satisfied with offerings of ice-cold Coca-Cola.

## Dragon Encounters

As the party travels through the mountain roads in their Ford F-150, they are attacked by dragons multiple times. During one encounter, Bru manages to "wrangle" a dragon, leading to claims that he now has a loyal dragon companion - though the exact details remain disputed among party members.

## The Mysterious Cabin

The party discovers a well-maintained cabin in the mountains where a woman is giving birth, assisted by a midwife. Initial investigations reveal:

**First Visit**: Silas scouts the cabin with Kevin (Bru's familiar) and observes the birth in progress before retreating.

**Return Visit**: The party returns to the same cabin (despite Elspeth's driving difficulties in the magical forest), where they encounter the midwife outside.

## Meeting the Midwife

Olivia speaks with the midwife, who reveals herself to be helpful and knowledgeable about the area:
- She knows about the smuggler's cave the party is seeking
- Explains that the cave systems have been used for generations to move goods in and out of High Forge
- Offers to help them find the correct goat path in the morning
- Mentions she was called to assist with a Blackstone family birth

## Underground Discovery

While the midwife tends to the new mother, Bru and Silas investigate the cabin grounds. Using explosives, they uncover a hidden entrance that leads to an elaborate underground facility:

**The Garage**: A massive underground garage containing:
- Six to seven luxury vehicles including a McLaren, Mercedes G-Wagon, and Bugatti
- Specialty race cars and vehicles typically only seen in the wealthiest districts
- An auto workbench with pristine, unused tools
- A massive ice chest containing turkeys, liquors, and ice-cold Coca-Cola
- Various magical/arcane technology controlling the vehicles and garage systems

**The Library**: Beyond the garage lies an opulent study featuring:
- Floor-to-ceiling bookcases with intricately carved wood
- Leather armchairs with animal pelts
- A fully stocked bar with expensive wines and liquors
- Records and documents detailing the Blackstone family history

## The Blackstone Family Records

Silas investigates the family documents and discovers troubling information:
- The Blackstones were originally known as the Hearth family, early doctors and settlers
- They changed their name after establishing successful obsidian mining operations
- Recent records show suspicious allegiances and strong connections to the Eldoran Empire
- They've been involved in violence trade with the Elder Empire
- The family has grown significantly wealthy in the past 50 years through questionable means

## The Great Car Heist Debate

The discovery of the luxury vehicles leads to intense party discussion about the ethics of theft:

**Pro-Theft Faction** (Bru, Silas):
- Argues the Blackstones are clearly wealthy elites involved in illegal activities
- Claims the vehicles could be useful for their mission
- Bru successfully starts a Bugatti and drives it out of the garage

**Anti-Theft Faction** (Elspeth, Olivia):
- Argues they don't know for certain these people are criminals
- Worries about stealing from potentially innocent people
- Elspeth refuses to let stolen car parts be used on her vehicles
- Olivia attempts to physically restrain the others from taking the cars

## Reaching the Smuggler's Cave

Despite the team splitting over the car theft (with Bru and Silas departing in stolen vehicles), both groups eventually reach the smuggler's cave:

**Cave Investigation**: The cave contains a large, dark hole leading deep underground. When Kevin is sent to investigate, he disappears for over an hour, eventually returning with bags of valuable materials:
- Sulfur (two bags)
- Violescence shards
- Silver coins
- Mining bags marked with dwarven glyphs

**Historical Context**: The discoveries suggest this is an old mining operation, with rail tracks leading deeper into the mountain system.

## Lady Corwin's True Motives Revealed

Through investigation and insight, Silas pieces together Lady Corwin's actual plan:
- She's not genuinely interested in freeing the city from altruistic motives
- This is a strategic business decision to position her family with the Eldoran Empire
- She plans to deliver the city to the Empire, allowing them to annex the violescence-rich region
- The mercenary army is real, but it's meant to establish Empire control rather than true liberation
- Her family would become the ruling governors under Empire authority, elevating them above other dwarven families

## Planning the Resistance

Realizing they've been manipulated, the party decides to keep the gold rather than deliver it as instructed. They begin planning their own resistance movement against Helga Ungar:

**Available Assets**:
- Dragons (potentially controllable via the orb, but risky)
- Ravers (possibly controllable through Helisanna's music)
- Mercenary army (could still be hired with their stolen gold)
- Luxury vehicles (for those who chose to keep them)

**Strategic Options Discussed**:
- Challenging Helga to various competitions (racing, wrestling, rock concerts)
- Using the orb to direct dragons against Helga's stronghold
- Infiltrating the Forge Heart during the chaos
- Creating a fake orb as a decoy

The session ends with the party having one week to plan and execute their assault on Helga Ungar, now working as independent resistance fighters rather than Lady Corwin's pawns.
