## Clarifying Note
This session takes place after the masquerade and before the vampire convent.

## The Birthday Invitation

The session begins at the astral tree village where **Isla** approaches the party with an unexpected invitation. She has received word about her grandfather **Thalrock Embermore's** 88th birthday party on her home plane of **Luminaria**. Due to time flowing differently between planes, Isla has missed ten years of family gatherings during her time away. 

The invitation extends to "Taco Cat," though **Thalrock** himself doesn't recall inviting them. The party learns that invitations are managed by **Laura**, the family's event planner, who allows family members to add guests to the list freely.

## Arrival at Luminaria

The party travels through a portal surrounded by glowing mushrooms, emerging onto the moss-covered grounds of the **Embermore Manor**. The plane exists in perpetual dusk with pink and purple skies, and every step on the moss causes it to glow softly. **Bru** immediately eats one of the glowing mushrooms, causing his belly to emit a warm light from within.

The manor itself is an impressive estate housing about 30 guests, primarily Goliaths and elves representing the extended family network.

## Meeting the Family

**Thalrock Embermore**, the 88th-year-old patriarch, greets them warmly despite not remembering the invitation. The party meets several key family members:

- **Kale**: Isla's step-brother, a beautiful elven man who has been managing family affairs during Isla's absence
- **Iridesa**: Kale's wife, described as having an "Instagram model" appearance with an unnaturally perfect look
- **Orithiel**: The family matriarch with severe features and a perpetual stern expression
- **Aelin and Vale**: Twin goth elven girls who are immediate fans of **Helisanna's** music

During dinner conversation, family tensions become apparent. Thalrock appears frail and has been coughing frequently, while **Iridesa** seems overly dramatic in her reactions.

## The Murder Mystery Becomes Real

As **Thalrock** raises a toast with red wine, he suddenly collapses at the dinner table, coughing up blood with black tendrils visible on his neck. **Retired Detective Olivia Cooper** immediately springs into action, using her investigative skills to examine the scene.

### Key Evidence Discovered

**Olivia's** investigation reveals:
- Black veins visible under Thalrock's skin near his neck
- A black film coating the wine glass, identified by **Isla** as **bloodthorn poison**
- The poison builds up over time, requiring long-term administration
- **Isla** reveals she's been treating Thalrock with healing salves applied to bandages on his neck

The revelation that Isla has been tending to exactly where the poison symptoms appear immediately makes **Orithiel** suspicious, leading to accusations that Isla killed her grandfather upon returning home.

## The Investigation Unfolds

### Evidence Collection Phase

The party conducts a thorough investigation of the manor:

**Kitchen Discovery**: All wine bottles intended for the evening contain the same black poison, with needle marks in the corks indicating systematic tampering.

**Office Investigation**: In Thalrock's study, they discover:
- A recently written will leaving everything to **Kale**, written in shaky handwriting
- **Helisanna** finds burned paper fragments in the fireplace
- **Olivia** reconstructs the original will, revealing it originally split inheritance four ways between Isla, Kale, and the twins

**Bedroom Searches**: 
- In **Kale's room**: Black-stained handkerchiefs indicating he's also been poisoned, but recently
- In **Orithiel's room**: A book of dark magic focusing on resurrection spells, with residue traces leading toward the sewing room

**The Sewing Room Discovery**: Behind a locked door, they find an complete apothecary setup containing:
- Bloodthorn poison in vials
- **Isla's** healing ingredients (explaining how she could access them)
- Spell components for necromantic rituals

## Confronting the Family

### Medical Examinations

**Red** and **Bru** attempt to examine family members for signs of poisoning, leading to chaotic scenes as they try to collect saliva samples from reluctant relatives. Their investigation reveals that **Orithiel** and **Kale** both show signs of long-term poisoning exposure.

### The Accusations Fly

**Olivia** presents the evidence systematically:
- The forged will giving everything to **Kale**
- The destroyed original will
- The systematic poisoning of wine bottles
- The apothecary setup in the locked sewing room
- **Kale's** symptoms of recent poisoning

When confronted, **Iridesa** becomes increasingly agitated and defensive. **Helisanna** attempts to use **Detect Thoughts** on her, discovering strange mental patterns focused on feeling "itchy" and uncomfortable.

## The Shapeshifter Revealed

As the evidence mounts and the family begins turning suspicious eyes toward **Iridesa**, she finally snaps. Screaming that the party was "supposed to be stupid" and referencing their previous encounter at "the masquerade with the fae dancing," **Iridesa** reveals her true nature by shapeshifting into a **night hag**.

The transformation reveals:
- Her "perfect" appearance was magical disguise
- She has been systematically poisoning the family for years
- Her plan involved eliminating Thalrock and other heirs to claim the inheritance through Kale
- She has knowledge of the party's previous adventures, suggesting broader connections

## Combat: The Night Hag Battle

### Initiative and Opening Moves

The night hag immediately attacks with **Ray of Enfeeblement** targeting **Olivia**, who successfully resists. **Red** opens with **Emboldening Bond**, connecting himself, **Bru**, and **Olivia** with divine energy that provides combat bonuses.

**Olivia** charges in with her battle axe, using **Divine Smite** to deal massive radiant damage and successfully knocking the hag prone with her weapon mastery abilities.

### Escalating Threats

**Helisanna** casts **Hex** on the night hag before attacking with her guitar axe, adding necrotic damage to her strikes. Just as the battle begins to favor the party, **two etter caps** crash through the dining room windows, climbing onto the ceiling and adding aerial threats to the encounter.

### Tactical Combat

**Red** deploys **Spirit Guardians**, filling the dining room with spectral Goliath warriors wielding tomahawks. The 15-foot radius effect covers most of the room, forcing wisdom saves from all enemies.

**Bru** deploys his **Eldritch Cannon** in force ballista mode, dealing significant damage and using the push effect to keep enemies at range. When one etter cap webs him, **Red** uses his weapon to free his ally with a critical hit that completely destroys the restraints.

**Olivia** proves devastatingly effective against undead creatures, her radiant damage cutting through the night hag's defenses while her protective abilities keep the party alive.

### Finishing Moves

**Helisanna** eliminates the first etter cap with coordinated **Eldritch Blast** attacks, causing it to explode in fiery webs and goo. **Bru** follows up with **Shatter**, using thunder damage to destroy the second etter cap by causing its eyes to roll back and blood to pour from its ears.

The night hag falls to **Bru's** force ballista, which launches her corpse across the room to splatter against the wall, leaving a trail of slime across the damaged floor.

## Resolution and Rewards

### Family Reconciliation

With the threat eliminated, the family processes the revelation that **Iridesa** was a supernatural predator who had infiltrated their household. **Kale** realizes the numerous red flags he had ignored, including her mysterious appearance from the woods and unexplained absences.

**Orithiel**, despite her severe demeanor, formally thanks the party for saving her family and offers them the prizes that were meant for the original murder mystery game.

### Detective-Themed Rewards

The party receives magical items themed around detective work:

- **Smoking Jacket** (taken by **Helisanna**): Provides +1 to Charisma, perfect for her performance career
- **Hat of Disguise** (taken by **Red** for **Elspeth**): Allows casting of Disguise Self while worn
- **Eyes of Minute Seeing** (taken by **Olivia**): Provides advantage on Intelligence checks relying on sight
- **Pipe of Smoke Monsters** (taken by **Bru**): Creates smoke illusions in the shape of creatures for entertainment

### Thematic Connections

The party realizes this encounter connects to their previous adventures, particularly their experience at the fae masquerade. The night hag's knowledge of their past suggests they may be dealing with connected threats across different planes.

## Session Themes and Impact

This interlude successfully blends classic murder mystery elements with D&D fantasy, allowing **Olivia's** detective background to shine while providing each character opportunities to contribute their unique skills. The session demonstrates the party's growing effectiveness at both investigation and combat encounters.

The revelation that seemingly innocent social gatherings can harbor supernatural threats reinforces the campaign's themes about hidden dangers in ordinary situations. The night hag's familiarity with the party's past adventures suggests their reputation is spreading across the multiverse, potentially attracting both allies and enemies.

The detective-themed rewards provide both mechanical benefits and roleplay opportunities, while the family drama adds emotional weight to what could have been a simple combat encounter. The session ends with the party having new magical items and renewed appreciation for thorough investigation before accepting mysterious invitations.

## Character Development Highlights

- **Olivia** demonstrates her investigative expertise and leadership during crisis situations
- **Red** shows improved tactical thinking with his Spirit Guardians placement and ally support
- **Bru** continues his evolution from chaotic wildcard to effective team member with strategic thinking
- **Helisanna** balances her performer persona with combat effectiveness and magical investigation
- The entire party shows growing coordination in both social and combat encounters

This interlude serves as both a satisfying standalone adventure and important character development, while advancing the broader campaign narrative through connections to previous encounters and hints at future threats.
