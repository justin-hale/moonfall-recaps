## Session Overview

The party returns to **Toonlock's** realm with all three required items (the mask, priest's stole, and mystical dagger) to help him sever his connection to the astral tree and escape **Crowley's** assault. What follows is a series of intense battles and a climactic confrontation with Crowley himself.

## Opening Recap and Ogre Guardian Battle

The session begins with a recap of the party's journey through **The Hollow** swamp, including their passage through magical fog, cliff climbing, spider encounters, and bridge crossing. As they approached the **Wichita Sisters'** cave, they discovered what appeared to be a moss-covered boulder was actually a massive **ogre-like creature** (similar to a Hinox from Breath of the Wild) that served as the cave's guardian.

### Combat: The Cave Guardian

The massive creature, wielding an uprooted tree as a club, engaged the party in brutal combat:

**Opening Moves**:
- **[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)** charges in with his greatsword, dealing solid damage while invoking Eldora's name
- **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** casts **Spirit Guardians**, surrounding himself with spectral Goliath warriors
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)** opens fire with her magical gun, dealing consistent damage

**Tactical Highlights**:
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna)** successfully casts **Tasha's Hideous Laughter**, incapacitating the ogre for a crucial turn
- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** struggles with his attacks but eventually lands significant hits
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** deploys his **Eldritch Cannon** and uses **Faerie Fire**, outlining the creature in blue light for advantage

**Devastating Counterattack**: The ogre performs a massive tree swing that catches multiple party members, dealing 25 damage to those who fail their strength saves and knocking **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** prone.

**Final Assault**:
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** delivers a spectacular finishing blow, dealing 51 damage with a critical hit enhanced by **Divine Smite**
- She describes cutting the ogre's legs out from under him, then repeatedly smashing his head with a goblin skull while using her battle axe

## Post-Combat and Loot

After defeating the guardian, the party takes trophies:
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)** carves off **ogre ivory** (teeth/bone) for crafting purposes
- **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** demonstrates his new **Returning** weapon enchantment on his tomahawk
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** provides everyone with temporary hit points using his cannon's protective mode

## Return to Toonlock's Realm

Arriving back at **Toonlock's** realm, the party finds it under heavy assault and barely holding together. The walls are destroyed, facilities smashed, and skeleton minions running in panic.

### Combat: Tweedledee and Tweedledum

Two massive (15-foot tall) humanoid creatures resembling **Tweedledee and Tweedledum** in schoolboy caps and red overalls attack the party:

**Enemy Abilities**:
- **Bite attacks** that deal both physical and psychic damage with nightmare imagery
- **Powerful punches** that knock targets prone
- Coordinated assault on the front-line fighters

**Party Performance**:
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna)** attempts **Command** but fails against their wisdom saves
- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** flanks effectively, dealing 28 damage with sneak attacks and precision strikes
- **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** supports with **Emboldening Bond** and **Spiritual Weapon**
- **[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)** rages and delivers consistent greatsword damage
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** devastates one creature with 49 damage using **Divine Smite** and weapon mastery
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** provides artillery support with his **Force Ballista** and **Firebolt**
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)** and **BoxBox** coordinate to deliver the killing blow on the second creature

## Joel's Dramatic Rescue

As the caterpillar creature (from previous encounters) looms over the party with a cigarette holder weapon, it suddenly freezes in pain. **Joel** explodes out of the creature's stomach in a spectacular display, calmly retrieving his cowboy hat and holstering his gun before stumbling slightly and ruining the cool moment.

**Joel** appears exhausted from non-stop fighting but warns the party that **Crowley** is approaching and they need to get to **Toonlock** immediately.

## Crowley's Intimidation

As the party rushes toward **Toonlock's** sanctum, **Crowley** appears, walking calmly with his hands behind his back. His unnervingly familiar whistle pierces the air as **Joel** desperately tries to hold him off, urging the party to run.

## The Ritual Chamber

Inside **Toonlock's** sanctum, the party finds the fox-like being emaciated and sitting in a lotus pose within a magical sigil. He explains they must work quickly as he can only suppress **Crowley** temporarily.

### The Severance Ritual

**Toonlock** begins the dangerous ritual to sever his realm from the astral tree:
- He dons the **mask** (like Daredevil's first season hood)
- Wraps the **priest's stole** around his shoulders  
- Takes the **mystical dagger** in hand

The scene swirls into mist, transporting them inside the astral tree itself, where **Toonlock** must sacrifice part of himself to complete the separation.

### Combat: The Tree's Guardian

As **Toonlock** begins drawing magical sigils, the astral tree fights back, manifesting a **massive humanoid shape** made of vines and bark that screams its defiance.

**Enemy Characteristics**:
- **Oak tree-sized** manifestation with devastating attacks
- **Life-draining roots** that attempt to burrow into party members
- **Massive reach** allowing it to attack multiple targets

**Tactical Combat**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** demonstrates exceptional skill with 43 damage from a critical sneak attack
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** uses **Shining Smite** to give the entire party advantage on all attacks
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna)** uses **Dissonant Whispers** to force the creature to move and provoke opportunity attacks
- **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** supports with **Spiritual Weapon** and healing while maintaining **Emboldening Bond**
- **[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)** adapts to ranged combat when the creature moves away
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** deals consistent damage with **Force Ballista** and **Catapult**
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)** lands a critical hit for 25 damage with her magical gun

**Finishing Move**: **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** delivers the killing blow with his **Returning Tomahawk**, describing a slow-motion throw that wedges into the creature before exploding with magical force.

## Crowley's Final Threat

Just as **Toonlock** is about to complete the ritual, time freezes around everyone. **Crowley** appears telepathically, making his final offer and threat:

### The Ultimatum

**Crowley** reveals he thought their involvement was finished and offers them one last chance to stop **Toonlock** and "earn his forgetfulness." When the party refuses:

**Threats and Revelations**:
- He has captured **Caspian** and is holding her in his realm
- He knows all their names, including **[Red](/player-characters/Red)'s** true name (**Thurnok**)
- He makes it clear this is personal now that they've interfered with his plans

**Character Interactions**:
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** insists on "Retired Detective [Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia) Cooper" rather than first names
- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** refuses to engage in conversation due to **Crowley's** "creepy voice"
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna)** points out his poor definition of "friend"
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** notes that **Crowley** knew his name without being told

## Ritual Completion

After **Crowley** vanishes, **Toonlock** completes the ritual by:
- Cutting off his own hand with the dagger
- Using his blood to complete the magical sigil
- Successfully severing his realm from the astral tree

## Resolution and Rewards

Back in **Toonlock's** damaged stronghold, the grateful host provides rewards for the party's service:

### Joel's "Reward"
**Joel** gives each party member an **autographed headshot** of himself, which the party receives with varying degrees of enthusiasm and confusion.

### Toonlock's True Gift

**Toonlock** grants each party member the **Fey-Touched feat**, manifesting as fox tattoos on their shoulder blades. This powerful boon provides:
- **+1** to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (player's choice)
- **Misty Step** spell once per day
- One **level 1 Divination or Enchantment spell** once per day

**[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** immediately chooses **Comprehend Languages** as his additional spell, demonstrating strategic thinking for future adventures.

## Session Themes and Development

### Escalating Threats

The session effectively escalates tension from environmental challenges through increasingly dangerous combat encounters to cosmic-level threats, culminating in **Crowley's** personal vendetta against the party.

### Character Growth

Each party member demonstrates their evolving abilities and personalities:
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)'s** devastating paladin abilities and professional demeanor
- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)'s** precision combat and strategic thinking
- **[Red](/player-characters/Red)'s** growing confidence with divine magic and weapon skills
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna)'s** tactical spellcasting and performance abilities
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)'s** artillery expertise and creative problem-solving
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)'s** consistent damage output and mechanical reliability

### Moral Complexity

The party's decision to help **Toonlock** despite **Crowley's** threats shows their commitment to protecting innocent beings, even when it puts them in personal danger.

## Ongoing Plot Threads

1. **Crowley's Vendetta**: The fae entity now considers the party personal enemies and has their true names
2. **Caspian's Capture**: The winter goddess's assistant needs rescue from **Crowley's** realm
3. **Joel's Knowledge**: The cowboy has information about **Crowley** that could prove crucial
4. **Astral Tree Access**: The party's connection to the astral tree provides ongoing adventure opportunities
5. **Power Growth**: The **Fey-Touched** feat represents significant character advancement

## Session Conclusion

This interlude successfully concludes the **Toonlock** rescue arc while setting up future conflicts with **Crowley**. The combination of intense combat encounters, character development, and cosmic-level stakes creates a satisfying conclusion that opens new narrative possibilities.

The **Fey-Touched** feat represents not just mechanical advancement but story recognition of the party's heroic actions and their growing connection to otherworldly powers. The session ends with the promise of future adventures as different party members prepare to take turns as DM, using the astral tree as a gateway to infinite possibilities.

The successful completion of this mission demonstrates the party's evolution from local troublemakers to cosmic heroes capable of influencing conflicts between powerful otherworldly beings, while **Crowley's** personal interest in them ensures future adventures will have appropriately high stakes.
