### 🏙️ Setting: High Forge
The party is in the dwarven city of **High Forge**, a place with strict rules. Foreigners are generally restricted to the **Market Ward** unless they have paperwork or sponsorship.

- **Location**: A raucous rock venue in the Market Ward.

Teams typically include:
- **Racer**
- **Mechanic**
- **Spotter**
- **Saboteur** (to disrupt other teams)

- A **Warforged named Racecar** arrives with a cryptic warning: *“You should not race. You are being targeted.”*
