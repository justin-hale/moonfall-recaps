### 🏙️ Setting: High Forge
The party is in the dwarven city of **High Forge**, a place with strict rules. Foreigners are generally restricted to the **Market Ward** unless they have paperwork or sponsorship. The Market Ward is full of inns, traders, bars, and entertainment venues—and hosts the city’s underground racing scene.
### 🎸 Act I: The Rock Show & Social Hub
- **Location**: A raucous rock venue in the Market Ward.
- **Hellasana** has picked up a late-night performance slot. The crowd is small but energetic, and she becomes a local sensation for the night, gathering an impromptu fan club.
- **Bru** assists with technical support, tearing down gear and lamenting poor-quality stage setup by the prior act.
- **Silas** negotiates a lucrative performance contract with the venue while holding a mysterious briefcase full of gold.
### 🏁 Act II: Elspeth’s Underground Racing Comeback
- **Elspeth**, a former professional racer, is navigating her return to the underground scene after a controversial disqualification.
- At the bar, she meets her former associate **Thelvult**, now sponsored by a major team.
- She reveals to Thelvult that she believes she was framed for race cheating (overpowering her vehicle), and that her car had been tampered with.
- Thelvult encourages her to join the upcoming underground race, providing her with contact info for **Miss Talks**, the punk-rock headhunter managing race entries.
- Elspeth signs up under the name **Team Cooper**, aware this might draw attention.
### 🏎️ Race Structure and Team Roles
The underground race on Sunday is large-scale (rumored 100 participants) and chaotic.
Teams typically include:
- **Racer**
- **Mechanic**
- **Spotter**
- **Saboteur** (to disrupt other teams)
- **Law Influencer** (to manipulate legal consequences mid-race)
Elspeth contemplates assembling her allies for these roles but hasn’t made formal asks yet.
### 🧳 Act III: The Briefcase Heist
- **Silas**, **Red**, and **Elspeth** leave the club with a briefcase full of gold.
- Red carries Silas and the case through the city like a bodyguard.
- They attempt to reach **Olivia’s apartment** in the residential area, but are stopped by city guards. Visitors need special papers.
- Silas decides to forge the necessary documents using his charlatan skills, which will take at least an hour.
- The group detours back to a rented **garage**, where Elspeth discovers someone has tampered with her race car.
### 🛠️ Act IV: Investigation and Sabotage
- While inspecting her vehicle, Elspeth confirms sabotage—someone who understands car mechanics tried to subtly damage her rig.
- Olivia joins the garage group early the next morning and sets up coffee and food.
- A **Warforged named Racecar** arrives with a cryptic warning: *“You should not race. You are being targeted.”*
- Racecar gives a clear description of the saboteur: a short, green-skinned goblin wearing black (turtleneck, gloves, pants). The team now has a suspect.
- Olivia, suspicious, interrogates Racecar and confirms the sabotage warning is real, but Racecar cannot name the culprit.
### 🍷 Act V: Hellasana & Bru’s Drunken Adventure
- Hellasana and Bru, basking in post-show fame, party hard at the bar.
- Hellasana handles adoring fans while Bru gets blackout drunk.
- Bru eventually falls into a pool on the way to the motel and wanders lost before finally finding his room around 7 a.m.
- Hellasana secures her room with a fraction more dignity.
### 🔍 Act VI: Olivia’s Side Story – George & Finnegan
- Olivia spends her night alone investigating the disappearance of her grand-nephew **George**.
- She stops by a local **bodega** (owned by “Bo Dega”) and chats with a shopkeeper.
- She learns George was seen with a suspicious halfling named **Finnegan**—charming, young, blonde, and always around shady people.
- Back at her apartment, Olivia finds a surprise note on her conspiracy board:
> *“If I go missing, find my lockbox under Olivia Cooper. – George”*
- She adds “Finnegan” to her growing board of suspects and notes to install a security system.
### ☀️ Act VII: Morning of the Guild Job
- As dawn breaks, the garage group wakes to coffee and muffins thanks to Olivia.
- They prepare for their 6 a.m. meeting with the **Steven Guild**, who had hired them to protect a caravan.
- The team shares intel about the upcoming race, Racecar’s warning, and the need to find out who sabotaged Elspeth’s car.
- Silas warns Red about a local **Twilight Company** branch operating near the venue—possibly dangerous or relevant to the race.
- The group now juggles multiple threads:
  - A risky underground race
  - A mysterious goblin saboteur
  - A missing family member
  - A performance tonight
  - And a morning caravan job for the Steven Guild
