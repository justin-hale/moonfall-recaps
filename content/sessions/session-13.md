## Session Overview

In this pivotal session, the party deals with the aftermath of their battle at the corrupted druid shrine, makes crucial decisions about Frankie's lycanthropy, and uncovers devastating truths about [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s family history while accidentally destroying evidence in a house fire.

## Key Events

### Closing the Portal

The session opens with **Eleanor** successfully closing the infernal portal at the shrine using her ancestral amulet. The portal collapses after a final desperate attempt by devils to break through, with a spectral clawed hand trying to drag itself into the world. Eleanor's magic prevails, cleansing the shrine and restoring it to its natural state as gentle rain begins to fall and flowers bloom where corruption once festered.

Eleanor presents the **Portal-Closing Amulet** to [Red](/player-characters/Red), explaining it can be used to close other infernal rifts they might encounter in their travels.

### Frankie's Transformation Decision

The party engages in an extensive discussion about **Frankie the werewolf's** future. Eleanor offers three options:

1. **Full healing** - Complete removal of lycanthropy
2. **Controlled lycanthropy** - Maintain werewolf abilities with control, but risk becoming an uncontrollable beast during rare celestial alignments (twice yearly)
3. **Status quo** - Remain as currently affected

The decision is complicated by the presence of the **artificial Eldoran moon**, which forces Frankie to transform every night rather than just during full moons. After much deliberation and discussion about celestial alignments and potential solutions (including jokes about "blowing up the moon"), the party unanimously chooses **full healing**. Eleanor successfully performs the ritual, restoring Frankie to human form.

### Political Aftermath in Milstrom

Returning to town, the party encounters a **town meeting** at the Common Mug. The citizens are debating their future governance after the mayor's death:

- **Willamay** advocates for a democratic council elected by the people
- **Boone Rockwell** suggests expanding the existing council structure rather than complete change
- **Maggie** and **Big O** support whatever keeps the community strong

When asked for their input, the party's suggestions range from single leadership ([Silas](/player-characters/Silas)) to representation and accountability ([Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)) to completely unconventional ideas (Goblin Law from [Bru](/player-characters/Bru)). Ultimately, they recommend taking time to consider all options rather than making hasty decisions, leading the town to **postpone the decision for a month**.

### The Magnolia Investigation

Following up on **Roscoe's** tip about [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s parents' murder, the party visits **Magnolia**, an elderly halfling woman who lives in a cottage filled with quilted furniture. During their visit over tea (which contains mild hallucinogenic herbs), Magnolia reveals crucial information:

- She witnessed **Zeke** leaving [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s parents' house on the night they died
- She overheard an argument between Zeke and [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s parents
- After Zeke left, she heard [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s parents discussing how "Zeke knows too much" and that "maybe they will take care of him"
- She then heard sounds of violence and believes it was a murder-suicide triggered by whatever Zeke told them

**Important Note**: Magnolia's reliability as a witness is questionable due to her regular consumption of mildly psychoactive tea that affects memory.

### Breaking into Zeke's Cottage

The party locates **Zeke's cottage** in the woods, finding it apparently empty but with a fire still burning. **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** successfully picks the lock after disarming a needle trap, but the group's investigation leads to disaster:

**Key Discoveries**:
- **Zeke's Journal**: Reveals he is a **spy for the Eldoran Empire**
- **Murder Revelation**: Zeke deliberately **poisoned the well water** at [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s family home, making their deaths appear like illness rather than murder
- **Surveillance**: Zeke has been monitoring [Red](/player-characters/Red) and tracking Goliath movements in the mountains
- **Escape Plans**: Recent entries suggest Zeke was preparing to leave town

**The Fire Disaster**: While investigating, the party accidentally causes a **grease fire** when trying to extinguish Zeke's cooking pot. Their attempts to put it out with water only make it worse, and the cottage burns down completely. Fortunately, they escape with Zeke's journal and a bag of the same herbs Magnolia uses in her tea.

### The Chase and Escape

Using survival skills enhanced by psychic abilities, **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** tracks Zeke's trail from the burned cottage to the Gold Road, where they discover:
- Zeke rendezvoused with horses and riders
- Purple wisps (possibly magical tracking traces) lead toward the horizon
- He has too much of a head start to catch on foot

The party realizes Zeke is likely heading to **Eldora**, putting their investigation on hold until they can follow.

### Negotiating the Caravan Delay

Before departing on the Pilgrim's Path to search for **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)'s grandson George**, the party needs to handle their contract with **Tien's tiefling trading caravan**. **Helisana** attempts to negotiate having them wait, but despite having advantage from party assistance, rolls poorly and ends up agreeing to **pay 200 gold** for the traders to wait in Milstrom during their detour.

### Setting Out on the Pilgrim's Path

The session concludes with the party beginning their journey on the **Pilgrim's Path** with **Roscoe** as their guide. The landscape shifts from vibrant colors to muted grays as they climb into the mountains, following ancient stones marked with the balanced scales of **Tyr**. 

They make camp for the evening and spot a **shepherd's cottage** with smoke rising from its chimney, setting up the next leg of their adventure.

## Character Development & Relationships

- **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** processes the devastating revelation about his parents' murder and the identity of their killer
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** demonstrates leadership in political discussions and shows crafting skills by making gifts
- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** proves invaluable with his investigative and stealth abilities, though his greed continues to be a defining trait
- **Helisana** struggles with substance use throughout the session, affecting her social interactions
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** maintains his explosive enthusiasm while being "managed" by the more responsible party members

## Ongoing Plot Threads

2. **George's Search**: Following the Pilgrim's Path to find [Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)'s grandson
3. **The Artificial Moon**: Ongoing concerns about the Eldoran Empire's fake moon
4. **Caravan Contract**: 200 gold expense and time pressure to complete the pilgrimage
5. **Portal Network**: The amulet suggests more infernal rifts may need closing

## Session Themes

This session expertly balanced investigation, character development, and world-building while advancing multiple plot threads. The accidental destruction of evidence added tension and consequences to the party's actions, while the revelation about [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s parents provided crucial backstory development. The session maintained the campaign's blend of serious moments and comedic interactions, particularly around party dynamics and substance use.

The title "Burning Down the House" perfectly captures both the literal house fire and the metaphorical burning down of [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s understanding of his family's fate, making this a memorable and impactful session in the campaign's narrative arc.
