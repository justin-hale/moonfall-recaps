## Opening Discussions

The session began with the group catching up on personal matters and discussing various topics ranging from Luke's upcoming week off from work to pursue game development, to vehicle preferences (Ford F-150 product placement continues), to Nashville traffic complaints and pizza preferences. The conversation revealed character insights about gaming, work-life balance, and regional pizza styles.

## Investigation at Rattie's Pie Land

### Meeting Detective Chalk Rock
The party encountered recently hired detective **Chalk Rock**, a 16-year-old dwarf with an unhealthy obsession with retired detective **Olivia Cooper**. Chalk Rock had been investigating the disappearance of **April Bonal**, leading the party to **Rattie's Pie Land**, a pizza establishment owned by the tortle **Beonardo**.

### The Pizza Place Investigation
At Rattie's Pie Land, the party discovered:
- The establishment had been closed for about a week
- Dust had settled on surfaces, but some had been recently disturbed
- Footprints led to a sewer grate in the kitchen
- The freezer contained unusual ingredients including frozen lettuce, blueberries, and apples
- **Helisanna** discovered what she believed to be "cheese" (actually parmesan) and consumed some

### The Great Pizza Debate
The party engaged in extensive discussions about pizza quality and regional preferences:
- Rattie's Pie Land served thin crust pizza with no cheese and excessive tomato sauce
- This sparked debates about proper pizza preparation and toppings
- **Ohma** experienced his first taste of proper pizza later in the session
- Plans were made to establish their own pizza establishment in their pocket dimension

## Sewer Exploration and Discoveries

### Following the Trail
The party descended into the sewers following the footprints, where they discovered an underground encampment with:
- **April Bonal** - the missing person they were searching for
- **Beonardo** - Ohma's fellow monk from their order, running the pizza place above
- **Casey Bones** - another member of their group

### Reunion and Information Exchange
**Ohma** was reunited with **Beonardo**, learning that:
- Beonardo had been following leads about the fallen moon goddess
- He had been making authentic pizza in the sewers after taking over Rattie's Pie Land
- The original owner had disappeared six months prior
- April had recently escaped from laboratory experiments

### Intelligence Gathering
April provided crucial information about the **ravers** (drug-affected individuals):
- They are controlled by someone called **Crang One** (later corrected to **Kang One**)
- Kang operates from a nightclub in the underside of the city
- The ravers are being manipulated and controlled rather than acting of their own free will

## Planning and Preparation

### The Concert Strategy
The party refined their plan to use **Helisanna's** musical influence to counter Kang One's control over the ravers:
- Stage construction was already underway by influenced ravers
- They planned to coordinate a rock-off challenge with Kang One
- The goal was to defeat Kang in musical combat and then eliminate him

### Character Development
**Ohma's** first experience with proper pizza became a transcendent moment, awakening a deep appreciation for the combination of bread, cheese, and sauce. This led to extensive discussion about pizza preferences and the establishment of pizza-related goals for the party's pocket dimension.

## The Approach to Combat

### Journey to the Nightclub
The party followed **Beonardo** and **April** through the sewer system toward the underground nightclub where Kang One was performing. The session built tension as they prepared for a confrontation that would determine control over the city's raver population.

### Combat Preparation
As they approached the nightclub, the party could feel the pulsing music and see the glow of the underground establishment. The session ended with initiative being rolled as they prepared to face:
- **Kang One** - described as a giant baby-like creature in a leather vest with powerful musical abilities
- Multiple groups of charmed ravers (12 per group)
- Psychic attacks from Kang's musical equipment

## Key Character Moments

- **Helisanna** continued her drug usage, consuming what she thought was cocaine but was actually parmesan cheese
- **Ohma** experienced a profound awakening to the joys of pizza, establishing a new character motivation
- **Detective Chalk Rock** proved both helpful and deeply concerning with his obsessive behavior toward Olivia
- **Olivia** and **Elspeth** demonstrated their partnership by protecting the party from psychic attacks
- **Silas** established psychic communication links between party members

## Session Themes

The session masterfully balanced comedy with plot advancement, featuring:
- Extended discussions about food preferences and regional cuisine
- Character relationship development through shared experiences
- Investigation and mystery-solving elements
- Setup for a major confrontation with meaningful stakes
- Commentary on addiction, mind control, and free will through the raver storyline

The episode title "The Pizza Wars Begin" aptly captures both the extensive pizza-related discussions and the brewing conflict over territorial control, with food serving as both comic relief and a bonding experience for the characters.
