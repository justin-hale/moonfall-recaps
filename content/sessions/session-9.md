## Plot Events

### A Midnight Emergency
- Fred the gopher (from previous sessions) bursts into camp seeking Red's healing help. A child in the camp, Bori, has mysteriously fallen into a coma the same night his mother, Sela, awakened from her months-long coma.
- Olivia, Elspeth, and Red respond, leaving the rest asleep.
- Grogi, a friend of Bori’s, recounts that the boys met a “weird man in a white suit and top hat” in the woods the day before, who offered to "help" Bori’s mother in exchange for a trade.
- Olivia uses Divine Sense and detects a faint trace of evil on Bori but not on his mother.

### Gathering the Team
- Olivia wakes Helisanna and Bru without alerting Silas.
- Silas remains asleep in the van.
- The group agrees to investigate the mysterious encounter from the day before. Red’s medical check confirms that healing won’t help Bori—his state is magical in nature.

---

## Into the Woods

### The Crossroads Encounter
- Following Grogi’s directions, the party ventures into the eerie eastern woods under moonlight, accompanied by Red.
- At a crossroads, they hear humming—“Pop Goes the Weasel”—followed by the poem “The Tyger” by William Blake.
- A fae named **Mr. Crowley** appears: white suit, opera mask, pointy teeth, charming yet disturbing. He confirms he struck a deal with Bori, who gave up his own consciousness to save his mother’s life.
- Crowley offers a new deal: retrieve a **fox-shaped fae totem** from an ancient shrine in exchange for restoring Bori’s consciousness without reverting Sela back into her coma.

---

## Journey to the Shrine

### The Midnight Pool
- Guided by a magical mote of light Crowley provides, the party finds a hidden shrine in the heart of the woods.
- They uncover a dry celestial pool surrounded by old mirrors. When moonlight is properly reflected using the mirrors, a hidden staircase opens beneath the pool.

### Guardian of the Shrine
- Within the shrine, they find the totem on a fallen pedestal. As Helisanna approaches, a **skeletal bear with ram’s horns and green fire eyes** emerges.
- A battle ensues:
  - Bru and Red's fire spells are particularly effective.
  - Olivia and Boxbox (Elspeth’s steel defender) make a strong defensive duo, using reactions to deflect attacks.
  - Elspeth and Helisanna contribute with ranged and melee attacks.
  - The bear is destroyed after Olivia lands a devastating smite attack.

---

## The Decision
- Helisanna picks up the totem. Elspeth uses Identify and confirms it’s a powerful conjuration-linked item: a **Fae anchor** for the spirit known as **Tunlak**.
- A ritual could potentially summon Tunlak, but the components are unknown.
- The group debates whether to give the totem to Crowley, fearing long-term consequences.
- Ultimately, they choose to **honor the deal**.

---

## Return to Crowley
- Crowley appears at the crossroads, genuinely pleased. He accepts the totem and assures them Bori will awaken and he will leave the area in peace.
- Helisanna shakes his hand, sealing the deal.
- Crowley vanishes into the earth, leaving only his smile lingering in the air.

---

## Epilogue
- Back at the refugee camp, the party sees the family joyfully reunited: Bori, Sela, and Turek are all awake and well.
- Olivia warns Hoboken (the monk of Steyr) to spread word about Crowley and to **warn others against making fae bargains**.
- The party ends the night wary but victorious—having saved a child’s life, made a deal with a devilish fae, and unleashed possible consequences for the future.

---

## Notable Roleplay Moments
- **Crowley**’s eerie charm and poetic cadence adds gravitas to the fae bargain.
- **Helisanna’s playful yet bold nature** shines during her interactions with Crowley and her curiosity around the totem.
- **Olivia’s legalistic, justice-focused objection** to fae deals adds moral weight.
- **Elspeth’s utility and coordination with Boxbox** make her a tactical powerhouse.
- **Bru’s love of fire** causes a few forest fires, humorously downplayed.
- **Red’s support spells and pacifist nature** play a quiet but critical role.

---

## Themes
- **Moral ambiguity**: Should a deal with a fae be upheld for a good outcome?
- **Innocence and cost**: A child’s sacrifice underscores the theme of exploitation.
- **Choices and consequences**: The long-term effect of giving Crowley what he wants remains unclear.

## Session MVP
**Crowley** – For stealing every scene he was in and ratcheting up the creep factor in the best way possible.
