## Session Overview

The party conducts downtime activities in Milstrom, with Silas selling Joel headshots to fund their engineering projects. They encounter alternate timeline versions of Marcus and Scarlett, successfully recruiting the scientist to help with their pocket village while steering her away from dangerous time travel research. Helisanna gathers intelligence at the refugee camp, learning about High Forge's occupation and making contact with Lark, a former Iron Claws member who offers to guide them into the city.

## Opening: Downtime Activities and Joel's Headshots

The session begins with **Silas** conducting a downtime activity, selling the autographed **Joel** headshots that the party received during their interdimensional adventures. Silas collects all seven headshots from the party members (including Red's and Jasper's belongings) and approaches **Tien**, the tiefling who has established an arcane shop in Milstrom.

### The Sales Negotiation

**Silas** presents the mint condition, animated Joel headshots to **Tien**, claiming they came directly from Joel himself after the party helped him with interdimensional problems. Despite Tien not being a huge Joel fan personally, he recognizes the value of authentic memorabilia from a member of the legendary Steve Squad.

**The Deal**:
- **Silas** asks for 200 gold per headshot (7 total = 1,400 gold)
- **Tien** agrees to the price with **Olivia's** Zone of Truth confirming authenticity
- Payment is half in coin, half in violessence crystals and arcane components
- The materials are exactly what **Bru** and **Elspeth** need for their rocket schematics project

### Downtime Crafting Progress

**Bru** and **Elspeth** continue work on their advanced projects:
- **Pocket Village**: **Elspeth** successfully completes his intelligence check for invention, **Bru** succeeds on her arcana check for construction
- **Rocket Schematics**: Significant progress made with the 1,400 gold worth of materials from the Joel headshot sale
- **Helisanna** provides bardic inspiration to help with the crafting process

The party notes they need three more successful sessions to complete the pocket village if rolls continue going well.

## Meeting Scarlett: The Alternate Timeline Scientist

While setting up camp by the river near the refugee settlement, the party encounters a familiar argument between a **French-accented male painter** and a **blonde woman conducting experiments**. The party recognizes them as younger, alternate versions of **Marcus** and **Scarlett** from the destroyed timeline they previously visited.

### The Confrontation

**Bru** immediately becomes hostile toward **Marcus**, attempting to grapple him while demanding "the time gun." This leads to a chaotic scene where:
- **Marcus** successfully throws **Bru** into bushes repeatedly
- **Bru** uses **Color Spray** to blind Marcus in retaliation
- The party discovers that in this timeline, **Scarlett** is the scientist working on time/dimensional travel while **Marcus** is the artist

### Recruitment Success

Through careful negotiation, **Silas** convinces **Scarlett** to abandon her dangerous time travel research in favor of helping with their **pocket village** project. Key points:
- **Scarlett** admits her time travel prototypes are "incredibly explosive" and feels like a dead end
- She specializes in extra-dimensional space, making her perfect for their project
- The party successfully redirects her from world-destroying research to helpful engineering

## Intelligence Gathering at the Campfire

**Helisanna** conducts reconnaissance at the refugee camp's evening storytelling circle, gathering crucial intelligence about High Forge and potential opportunities:

### Information Discovered

**Smuggling Operations**:
- A dwarf named **Maria** successfully smuggled a large haul through High Forge's back tunnels
- The tunnels are patrolled but too vast for complete coverage

**Job Opportunities**:
- **Sarah**: A telephone operator seeking help retrieving her grandfather's Sunstone hammer from High Forge
- **Lab Assistant**: Offering cash for help with escaped specimens
- **Bank Vault Crisis**: Clockwork guardians malfunctioning, vault security compromised

**Political Situation**:
- **Helja** is collecting protection money and high taxes
- These funds are being used as "religious donations" to appease the dragons
- The dragons and Iron Claws are working together to maintain control

### The Conspiracy Theorist

A raggedy man wearing a tin can helmet warns about a greater conspiracy:
- Claims dragons, dancers, and even the secret resistance are all working together
- Believes they're trying to "open the portal" and "bring back the old one"
- Says it's all a "big welcome party" for some cosmic entity
- Other campers dismiss him as crazy, but his warnings may be prophetic

## Meeting Lark: The Iron Claws Contact

**Helisanna** makes contact with **Lark**, a scarred woman who reveals herself as a former **Iron Claws** member by showing her tattoo. Lark offers crucial assistance:

### The Deal
- **Lark** knows Iron Claws patrol patterns and tunnel systems
- She can guide them safely into High Forge through the tunnels
- In exchange, she wants help rescuing her brother **Tony's** family and their dog
- She provides a sending stone for coordination

### Critical Intelligence
- **Silas** has an extremely large bounty on his head from **Helja**
- The Iron Claws attacked their concert previously (which Helisanna claims not to remember)
- **Lark** strongly warns against using the "Taco Cat" name
- She advises extreme caution, especially for anyone connected to **Silas**

## Engineering Projects and Newcomer Integration

Back at camp, **Bru** and **Elspeth** work on integrating **Scarlett** into their projects while maintaining operational security:

### Project Collaboration
- **Scarlett** is impressed by their rocket schematics quality
- She experiences déjà vu moments, possibly from dimensional bleed-through
- **Bru** continues his obsession with "Brown," his chunky alcoholic creation
- **Scarlett** shows interest in smoothie-like efficiency of meals

### Security Concerns
The party can't reveal the source of their advanced schematics, maintaining compartmentalized information to protect their interdimensional contacts.

## Return and Planning

**Helisanna** returns to update the party on her intelligence gathering:

### Mission Updates
- Multiple job opportunities available in High Forge
- Confirmed guide (Lark) willing to help infiltrate the city
- **Silas** adopts the cover identity "Borat" for operational security
- The party must be extremely careful about their wanted status

### Tactical Considerations
- Multiple factions want them dead: Iron Claws, Eldoran Knights, possibly dragons
- They need to maintain low profiles and avoid advertising their presence
- The refugee camp has grown significantly, possibly becoming a permanent settlement

## Combat: The Bounty Hunter Ambush

The session concludes with a dangerous ambush as the party prepares to rest:

### The Threat
A heavily armored figure in black steel armor, accompanied by **the Jackals** mercenary group, surrounds their camp demanding the 50,000 gold bounty on "Taco Cat" - dead or alive.

### The Battle
**Initiative Order**: Helisanna (21), Elspeth (19), Silas (16), Bru (15)

**Round 1**:
- **Helisanna** attempts **Suggestion** on the leader but he saves
- **Elspeth** scouts enemy positions, identifying 4 total: the leader, two to the right, one to the left
- She successfully shoots the closest enemy for 17 damage
- **Silas** throws psychic daggers from concealment, hitting for 18 damage and tripping the target prone

**Round 2-3**:
- **Bru** uses his **Force Ballista** and **Firebolt** to eliminate enemies
- The mercenaries attempt to shoot into the van but mostly miss
- One heavily armored enemy on a mechanical horse attacks **Elspeth** with lance charges

**Critical Moments**:
- **Elspeth** climbs on top of the van for better positioning but gets knocked unconscious by the leader's dual mace attacks
- **Helisanna** uses **Eldritch Blast** with **Repelling Blast** to knock the leader off the van
- **Silas** delivers emotional revenge attacks after seeing Elspeth's blood, killing the leader while declaring his loyalty to his friends

### Victory and Consequences
The party successfully eliminates all bounty hunters but one who flees. Key discoveries from searching the bodies:
- These were **the Jackals**, a professional mercenary group
- They had set explosive traps along the escape route
- A second group was waiting at a cave halfway to High Forge
- The party disarms the traps for 10 gold worth of explosive components

## Character Development and Relationships

### Silas's Growing Bonds
**Silas** demonstrates genuine care for his companions, particularly in his violent response to **Elspeth's** injury, showing his evolution from purely selfish motivations to protective loyalty.

### Helisanna's Operational Challenges
**Helisanna's** tendency to be open about her identity creates security risks, requiring the party to coach her on maintaining operational cover when wanted by multiple factions.
