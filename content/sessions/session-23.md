## Session Overview

The party returns to Milstrom to process [Red](/player-characters/red)'s loss and discovers disturbing information about bounties on their heads, [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s supernatural influence over her fans, and a dangerous underground racing event that could be their next challenge.

## Examining the Rocket Schematics

The session opens with the party studying the rocket ship blueprints they acquired from the Skyhammer clan. **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** raises concerns about whether the technology requires human sacrifice to power it, similar to what happened to [Red](/player-characters/red). **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** and **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** examine the schematics to determine if they can modify the power source.

The party discusses using their abundant crystal collection as an alternative power source, including:
- Crystals from Eric's Eldoran armor
- Interdimensional crystals from Marcus
- Various other magical crystals they've accumulated

## Memorial for [Red](/player-characters/red)

The party decides to hold a memorial service for [Red](/player-characters/red) at his childhood home in Milstrom. However, upon arrival, they discover the house occupied by adults playing what appears to be **strip Twister**. After some awkward investigation (including insight checks to determine the exact nature of the game), the party evicts the squatters and sets up the memorial outside instead.

### The Memorial Service

- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** creates a makeshift headstone and lights a small fire
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** retrieves symbols of Tyr from the underground tunnels
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** crafts a commemorative figurine of [Red](/player-characters/red) using his artificer skills
- **[Jasper](/player-characters/jasper)** offers simple but heartfelt words: *"Wish we could have known you a bit longer there, pal. Hope you rest easy here in the earth and live free among the stars."*
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** remains silent but emotional, still clearly angry about [Red](/player-characters/red)'s sacrifice

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** receives a magical tattoo from **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** - a **Spell Wrought Tattoo** that allows him to recover one expended spell slot (3rd level or lower) once per day.

## Roscoe's Return

After the memorial, the party encounters **Roscoe**, the eccentric warforged, who joins them for drinks at the Milstrom Inn while singing Piano Man.

## The Bounty Hunter Encounter

### Meeting Roger

At the tavern, **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** overhears a suspicious conversation between a man and the barkeeper. The stranger, **Roger**, is asking about **Bo Dega** and offering a reward for information. When the party confronts him, Roger attempts to flee but is caught using **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s** Levitate spell.

### Intelligence Gathering

Under interrogation (enhanced by **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s** Zone of Truth), Roger reveals crucial information:

**The Iron Claws Takeover**:
- After the dragon attack on High Forge two weeks ago, the **Iron Claws gang** moved in and took control
- They now control the gates and monitor tunnel traffic
- The gang has established bounties on numerous people

**Active Bounties**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** has the largest bounty on his head
- **Bo Dega** also has a significant price
- Several other associates including "Victor" and "Lenny"

**The Ravers Phenomenon**:
- Groups of people with **purple eyes** have been gathering in High Forge
- They're described as "zombie-like" teenagers and young adults
- They spend time in the "under lake" area and are obsessed with music
- Their behavior began after **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s** concerts

### The Drug Connection

The party realizes the purple-eyed "Ravers" may be connected to:
- The drug-contaminated water they created when dumping Bo Dega's substances in the lake
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s** supernatural musical influence
- A combination of both factors

## Helisanna's Supernatural Influence

### Testing the Effect

**[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** performs for the locals and demonstrates her supernatural influence:
- **Purple mist** emanates from her performance and spreads through the area
- Local residents, including **Roger**, develop **purple eyes** and join in the musical performance
- The effect appears to primarily affect teenagers and young adults
- The party members themselves are unaffected

### Investigation into Her Patron

Under questioning from **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)**, **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** reveals limited information about her warlock patron:
- She made a pact in a dark place with purple flames or smoke
- The entity was described as androgynous with an otherworldly presence
- She received her magical abilities and instrument through this pact
- The supernatural effects on her audience appear to be automatic and uncontrolled

## The Underground Race

### Race Announcement

**[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** discovers her car radio has been activated remotely, announcing an underground race:
- **Meeting time**: Midnight at the Milstrom Inn
- **Race start**: 1 AM
- The announcement uses the same voice as Roger's radio contact, suggesting coordination

### Race Rules and Dangers

The race organizer, **The Warden**, explains the simple but deadly rules:
- Racers must drive up a mountain
- Grab a "crest" at the summit
- Return without getting eaten
- Only rule: the driver must personally retrieve the crest
- High likelihood of death for participants

### Participants

The race includes several familiar faces from [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)'s racing background:
- **Alesso**
- **Thelvolt** 
- **Racecar**
- **Lazarus**
- **The Warden** (organizer)

## Pre-Race Preparations

### Sabotage Operations

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** successfully drugs **Thelvolt** and another racer's drinks using a substance from their previous adventure with Marvin, hoping to impair [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)'s competition.

### Intelligence Gathering on The Warden

**[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** conducts surveillance on The Warden and makes several discoveries:

**The Radio DJ Revelation**:
- The Warden operates a radio station from his RV
- He plays music including songs by "Doomfall" (the party's band)
- His show includes commercial breaks and music programming
- He plays an eclectic mix including "Dixie Chicks" and Maroon 5

**Stealing Contracts**:
Working with **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** as a distraction, **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** breaks into the RV and steals:
- **All killer contracts** (organized alphabetically)
- **Racing contracts** (the thickest binder)
- The theft reveals organized criminal activity beyond just race organization

### Equipment Upgrades

**[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** acquires new racing modifications:
- **Wheel spikes** for offensive capability
- **Spoiler** for improved aerodynamics
- Plans to use their crystal collection to power the vehicle

## Character Development and Relationships

### Helisanna's Growing Concern

The revelation of her supernatural influence on teenagers creates moral concerns for **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)**, though she maintains it's unintentional. Her advice to a young fan to wait until 18 before doing drugs shows some responsibility, though the fan interprets this as permission.

### Silas's Criminal Past

The session reinforces the ongoing threat from **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)'s** theft of the dragon orb from the Iron Claws, with his bounty being the largest among the party members.

### Team Coordination

The party demonstrates improved coordination during:
- The interrogation of Roger using multiple skills and spells
- The heist operation at The Warden's RV
- Preparation for the upcoming race

## Ongoing Plot Threads

1. **Iron Claws Control**: The criminal organization now controls High Forge and actively hunts the party
2. **Purple-Eyed Ravers**: [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s supernatural influence creates concerning followers
3. **The Mountain Race**: A dangerous competition with unknown creatures threatening participants
4. **Stolen Contracts**: Evidence of organized criminal activity involving races and assassinations
5. **Bo Dega's Safety**: Their friend remains a target for bounty hunters
6. **Crystal Technology**: Potential for modifying the rocket technology using their acquired crystals

## Session Themes

This episode effectively balances grief processing with escalating external threats. The memorial for [Red](/player-characters/red) provides emotional closure while new dangers emerge through the bounty hunter encounter and race preparation. **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s** supernatural influence introduces moral complexity about unintended consequences of power, while the criminal contracts suggest the party has stumbled into a larger conspiracy involving underground racing and assassination networks.

The session sets up the dangerous mountain race as the next major challenge while establishing the Iron Claws as an ongoing antagonist organization with significant resources and reach.
