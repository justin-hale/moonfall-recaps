## Session Overview

The party continues their journey, examining rocket ship schematics and dealing with the aftermath of Red's death while new threats emerge and a dangerous racing event beckons.

## Rocket Ship Discussions

The session opens with the party examining rocket ship schematics, immediately concerned about whether this vessel requires human sacrifice for power like previous models they've encountered. **Silas** voices the concern directly, asking if they can verify and potentially replace any sacrificial power source with alternatives.

**Felonias Bru** and the artificers discuss potential power alternatives, including:
- Electricity
- Goliath power sources (which the party finds acceptable)
- The abundant interdimensional crystals they've acquired from Marcus and recent adventures

The party notes they're "lousy with crystals" from their recent acquisitions, suggesting multiple power source options for their vessel.

## Journey to Milstrom Inn

The party travels through the village on a sled as nighttime deepens, making their way to the familiar **Milstrom Inn**. Before settling in, they decide to hold a memorial service for **Red** at his childhood home.

## The Twister Incident

Approaching Red's childhood home, the party discovers the lights are on and hears loud activity inside. Upon investigation, they find adults playing what appears to be **strip Twister** in the living room. The party confronts the group:

- One shirtless participant claims the house belongs to him and demands the party leave
- **Olivia Cooper** firmly states this is their dead friend's house and orders the squatters out
- The Twister players reluctantly gather their equipment and leave for "Johnny's" house
- **Silas** performs an insight check, determining this was definitely not normal Twister based on the participants' intensity and sweatiness

## Red's Memorial Service

Outside the house, the party sets up a proper memorial for their fallen Goliath friend:

**Memorial Preparations:**
- **Elspeth** crafts a headstone and lights a memorial fire
- **Olivia** retrieves symbols of Tiara from the underground tunnel system beneath Red's house
- **Silas** attempts to whittle a commemorative figurine but struggles with the woodworking
- **Bru** assists Silas, creating a small statuette of Red for the tombstone

**Memorial Speeches:**
- **Jasper** delivers a heartfelt goodbye: "Wish we could have known you a bit longer there, pal. I hope you rest easy here in the earth and live free among the stars. Red, of the Goliaths I knew, you were one of them."
- **Bru** remains silent but visibly emotional, tears welling in his eyes while standing with arms crossed, still processing his anger over Red's death

The party takes time to individually pay their respects before heading to the inn.

## Drinking and Tattoos

At the **Milstrom Inn**, the party begins drinking heavily to cope with their grief. **Helisanna** decides to give out magical tattoos while intoxicated, offering one to **Silas**, who accepts and receives it on his back shoulder blade. The party discusses getting matching tattoos in Red's memory.

## Roscoe's Arrival

**Roscoe**, a warforged they've encountered before, stumbles through the woods singing Billy Joel's "Piano Man." He joins the party for drinks, and they share their reason for drinking - mourning their fallen friend Red. Roscoe expresses philosophical thoughts about death and consciousness while continuing to drink with them.

## The Bodega Investigation

**Bru** overhears a concerning conversation at the bar between a stranger and the barkeeper about someone named **"Bodega"** - a drug dealer the party knows. The stranger is seeking information about Bodega's whereabouts and mentions a reward.

**The Chase:**
- **Bru** alerts the party about the "narc" looking for Bodega
- The party pursues the stranger (later identified as **Roger**) as he flees
- **Helisanna** uses levitation to stop Roger's escape
- Roger attempts to call for backup using a communication device
- **Silas** successfully steals the device with sleight of hand and impersonates Roger to his contacts

## Roger's Revelations

Under interrogation (with **Olivia** casting Zone of Truth), Roger reveals crucial information:

**About the Iron Claws:**
- The criminal organization is actively hunting the party, especially **Silas**
- Silas has the highest bounty on his head
- The Iron Claws now control **High Forge** after dragon attacks two weeks prior
- They've set up checkpoints and monitor traffic through tunnels

**About High Forge's Current State:**
- Dragons attacked the city two weeks ago, killing most guards and soldiers
- The Iron Claws moved in suspiciously quickly, almost as if planned
- They control the front gates and monitor tunnel traffic
- Dragons primarily occupy the emperor's throne room atop the mountain
- Remnants of legitimate government either fled or now work for the Iron Claws

**About the "Ravers":**
- Groups of 100-1,000 people with purple eyes roam High Forge
- They're described as "mindless zombies" and "metalheads" 
- They appear to be connected to **Helisanna's** concerts and music

## Helisanna's Purple Eye Effect

To test Roger's claims about her music's effects, **Helisanna** performs for the small crowd. Her performance creates:
- Purple mist that spreads across the ground
- Purple glow in listeners' eyes, including Roger's
- Spontaneous musical participation from affected individuals
- The appearance of other townspeople joining in with instruments

**Key Observations:**
- The party members themselves are not affected by the purple eye phenomenon
- The effect seems to primarily impact teenagers and young adults (roughly 18-20 years old)
- Children and older adults appear immune
- Affected individuals become devoted fans but retain their cognitive abilities
- The effect appears stronger with extended exposure or full concerts versus single songs

## Racing Event Discovery

**Elspeth** hears her race car radio activate, broadcasting an announcement about a racing event:
- Meet at Milstrom Inn at midnight
- Race begins at 1 AM
- The radio voice sounds suspiciously similar to Roger's contact

The party realizes this could be a trap but **Elspeth** is determined to participate, using racing as her way to process grief over Red's death.

**Race Details from the Warden:**
- Objective: Drive up the mountain, grab "the crest," and return
- Primary rule: The driver must personally retrieve the crest
- Significant danger: Participants risk being "eaten" by something on the mountain
- Other racers include: Alesso, Thelvolt, Racecar, Lazarus, and the Warden

## Intelligence Gathering and Sabotage

**Silas's Sabotage Mission:**
- Successfully drugs the drinks of competitors **Dovolt** and another blue-skinned elf racer using substances previously acquired
- Uses reliable talent to ensure success of the operation

**Bru's Surveillance Mission:**
- Follows the Warden to his RV headquarters
- Discovers the Warden is also a radio DJ hosting a music show
- Observes organized shelves of contracts labeled: "Music Contracts," "Killer Contracts," and "Racing Contracts"
- Notes the Warden keeps a gun nearby

**The Heist:**
- **Silas** distracts the Warden with questions about filming rights and video technology
- **Bru** infiltrates the RV and steals:
  - All "Killer Contracts" (two binders, alphabetically organized)
  - The thickest "Racing Contracts" binder
- The team successfully extracts without detection, though the Warden becomes suspicious

## Session Conclusion

The party prepares for the dangerous mountain race while processing multiple threats:
- Active bounties from the Iron Claws organization
- The mystery of Helisanna's supernatural influence over young people
- The dangerous racing event that may be a trap
- Stolen contracts that may contain vital intelligence about their enemies

**Roger's Status:** Now under Helisanna's influence due to the purple eye effect, he's become a devoted fan rather than a threat, though his original bounty hunting mission remains a concern.

The session ends with one hour remaining before the race begins, setting up a tense and dangerous competition for the next session.
