## Recap of Previous Events
- The party had escaped High Forge and began traveling with a large caravan.
- They met Eleanor’s Wandering Coven, got introduced to a magic guild, and helped Fred, who now provides them with info.
- Fred brought them the case of Bori, a boy in a coma due to a deal made with a mysterious entity named Crowley.
- The party retrieved a fox totem from a shrine after solving a moonlight puzzle and fighting a guardian, then gave it to Crowley. Bori and his family recovered.


### Journey Toward Milstrom
- The caravan travels along a blighted, eerie landscape toward Milstrom.
- At a crossroads, the party meets two intimidating Eldoran Knights warning travelers to avoid Milstrom.
- The knights say the town has changed, hinting at dangerous, mind-affecting forces.
- The party, citing numerous quests tied to Milstrom, decides to proceed despite warnings.


### Context for Milstrom
The group lists their reasons for entering Milstrom:
- A blight affecting Eleanor’s shrine.
- The mystery surrounding the mayor’s disappearance and rumors of a political collective.
- The last known location of Finnegan and George (Project Purple Patch).
- A potential portal to hell.
- [Red](/player-characters/red)'s personal ties: family history and suspected involvement of the Twilight Company.
- Possible show venue for [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna) at the Common Mug tavern.


### Enter: The Vroomfall & Party Debate
- The party discusses tactics (talking vs. explosions) in their crowded Vroomfall van, full of allies and passengers.
- Political and social topics emerge, including the status of tieflings, who are recent hellspawn refugees, and commentary on racial/species mechanics in D&D.
- The party debates decision-making processes and considers votes, brute strength, and past combat performance.


### Arrival at Milstrom
- They talk their way past the Eldoran Knights checkpoint with Eleanor's help, receiving a brooch to report back with findings.
- The town appears unusually orderly and proud. The forest is blighted, and the townspeople wear red armbands.
- The Common Mug tavern is the social center. There are no street vendors or signs of a typical free market economy.
- Tobias the blacksmith mentions a collectivist movement led by someone named [Red](/player-characters/red) Lennon.


### Meet Roscoe
- The party meets Roscoe, a bizarre old Warforged with a makeshift digestive system from wish magic.
- Roscoe, clearly eccentric and alcoholic, offers valuable knowledge in exchange for beer—a lot of it.
- The party stealthily steals a keg from the tavern while the town holds a public trial.


### Show Trial at the Common Mug
- The party witnesses a chilling communist-style public tribunal.
- A woman named Willemay Hargreave is sentenced to execution at dawn for “counter-revolutionary activity.”
- Her accusations: questioning [Red](/player-characters/red) Lennon’s regime and warning about creeping authoritarianism.


### Tunnels and Revelations
- In exchange for the keg, Roscoe reveals:
  - A hidden trapdoor that leads to tunnels beneath Milstrom, used by pilgrims to avoid the town.
  - Directions to the corrupted shrine, detailed via a drunkenly hand-drawn but decipherable map.
  - Information about Willemay’s dissent and religious alignment (devoted to Tyr).
  - Confirmation that the town is under subtle magical corruption stemming from [Red](/player-characters/red) Lennon—a literal devil from hell.
  - Insights about [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s nephew Finnegan and George, who passed through these tunnels in pursuit of a pilgrimage.


### The Pilgrim Route and Next Steps
- The party uses Roscoe's tunnels and map to plan their approach.
- They face moral quandaries:
  - Should they intervene in Willemay’s execution?
  - Can they defeat [Red](/player-characters/red) Lennon and break his corruptive influence on the town?
- [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) and [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth) reflect on familial ties and motivations.
- Roscoe encourages them to act quickly, warning of [Red](/player-characters/red) Lennon’s hold on the town’s morality and politics.
