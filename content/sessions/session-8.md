## 🚚 Escape from High Forge and Into the Wild

The party finally leaves the deep tunnels under High Forge, emerging into the dawn-lit foothills of the surrounding mountains. As they rejoin a larger caravan of fleeing citizens and merchants, the group maintains a low profile while still accompanied by Bo, the Twilight Company remnants, and the now-painted vehicles: **Vroomfall** and **Zoomfall**.

- **Van aesthetics update**: Vroomfall now features the iconic “Three Steve Moon” (wolves wearing sunglasses) howling at a stylized moon.
- **Zoomfall** is painted in a Mad Max–inspired style, waiting on Ellie’s final flair.

## 🧪 A Wave of Revelations

The session opens with a retrospective on **Silas’ backstory**:
- Silas and Bru were once part of a gang that stole a powerful artifact from the criminal syndicate **The Iron Claws**.
- The stolen item is a **glass orb containing a dragon**, which is extremely dangerous if mishandled (e.g. stored in a Bag of Holding).
- The Iron Claws are now actively pursuing Silas by name—meaning his current identity has been compromised.

Other shocking reveals include:
- **Olivia’s family cat**, Bodega, is implicated in drug smuggling—using produce to transport a dangerous eye-drop drug called "V".
- Olivia is devastated to learn her local bodega may have been a front for narcotics.

## 💰 Loot Recap & Equipment Shopping

The group discusses gold totals:
- Everyone received **2,000g**, contributed **666g** each for a **Bag of Holding**, leaving **1,334g** remaining per player.
- Olivia, Elspeth, and others consider what items to buy. Common and uncommon items are approved.
- Clarifications about heavy armor proficiencies are made, especially with updated 2024 rules.
- Healing potions are recommended for low-slot clerics.

## 🌄 Traveling Toward Milstrom

The party travels with the caravan toward **Milstrom**, Red's hometown.

- **Bo** questions what’s next for him after High Forge. Olivia tries to keep him on the moral path.
- **Silas confesses** he's rattled that his “clean” identity was discovered by the Iron Claws.
- The party confirms the town's name is **Milstrom**, though it takes a while to recall.

## 🛑 Paladin Encounter: Religious Persecution

A disturbing road encounter introduces **Eldoran paladins**—human knights wielding weapons and armor embedded with **violaceous crystals** (the same material powering Elspeth’s racer).

- They are **forcing refugees to swear allegiance to Empress Eldora**, demanding abandonment of their former gods.
- A knight accosts a dwarven monk who refuses to forsake **Tyr**.
- Olivia, Elspeth, and Red intervene—Olivia tries diplomacy, Elspeth supports, and Silas pretends she’s a senile grandma to de-escalate.
- Silas rolls a **29 deception**, diffusing the situation.
- The monk, named **Hoboken**, joins the caravan under the party’s protection.

- This is the **first canon introduction of Tieflings** into the world—players are stunned.
- The family brought wealth and skills with them, earning a place in society and launching a merchant operation.

## 📜 Eleanor's Offer: The Blight and the Hearth Seed

The party is approached by **Eleanor**, a halfling hedge mage from **Eleanor’s Wandering Coven**:
- She asks for help taking a **Hearth Seed** to a **Druidic Altar** near Milstrom to counteract a mysterious **blight** affecting the area.
- She implies that this may be linked to deeper corruption or the nearby **hell rift**.
- Red is visibly disturbed—his hometown is falling apart.

## 🌙 Final Thoughts

The party rests under the stars as Bo's caravan and Tien's family merge with their group. Hellasana is drunk, Red is contemplative, Silas is scheming, and Olivia remains ever vigilant. With their next destination looming, Milstrom promises answers—but also deeper mystery and danger.
