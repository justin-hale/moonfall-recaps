### Olivia's Investigation
- **Detective [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) Cooper**, recently retired, begins the session by investigating a mysterious lockbox left in her name.
- Inside, she finds a set of **color-coded journals** authored by her grandson **George**, who was last known to be working with the **Twilight Company**.
- George’s notes detail a mysterious operation called **Project Purple Patch**, feuds among High Forge’s underground gangs, and a religious mission involving **Father Jacob** and **Mother Asuka**.
- George was last seen heading north on a **pilgrimage** tied to the **Church of Tyr**.
- [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) finds a lead in the journals pointing toward a halfling named **Finnegan**, an information broker who has interfaced with both Twilight Company and the gang **Iron Claws**.
### Reuniting the Crew
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**, **[Red](/player-characters/red)**, and [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) reconvene at a **garage** after a period of scattered rest.
- The party shares updates: [Red](/player-characters/red) reveals a **Twilight Company hit order** against “Healing Touch” — his parents — marked with a certified stamp.
- [Silas](/player-characters/silas) confirms the order looks official, despite the Twilight Company not typically engaging in contract killings.
- The group decides to dig deeper into the Twilight Company’s network and determine how and why [Red](/player-characters/red)’s parents were targeted.
### A Trip to the Cathedral
- The trio visits the **Cathedral of Tyr**, which doubles as a courthouse and jail.
- [Red](/player-characters/red) grapples with the revelation that his pacifist beliefs may have been sheltered from the harsher doctrines of Tyr’s justice.
- [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) secures a **sealed letter of authority** from the bishop, sanctioning her to investigate George’s disappearance on the Church's behalf.
### The Twilight Company Meeting
- The group attends an **open Twilight Company meeting** held under a bar called the **Little Hobble**.
- [Silas](/player-characters/silas), under the alias **Martin Birchwood**, marks himself as a member using Thieves’ Cant to gain deeper access.
- Jobs listed at the meeting include car sabotage, political canvassing, artifact theft, and scouting missions — but **no hit jobs**, confirming the rarity of [Red](/player-characters/red)’s note.
- [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) speaks with leaders including **Cyrus**, **Rekha (tiefling)**, and **Vector (dwarf)**, learning George last checked in from **Lonnie’s Bar & Grill in Milstrom**, en route to a shrine in the mountains.
### Key Intel
- **Project Purple Patch** appears compromised; **Finnegan** is on a mission to investigate, meeting someone called **Lady Viper**.
- **Twilight Company’s hierarchy** includes an inner circle; [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) and [Red](/player-characters/red) are identified by name and purpose by members, especially the observant Rekha.
- [Silas](/player-characters/silas) eavesdrops on internal discussions, learning about Twilight’s role in manipulating **High Forge politics** and **counterbalancing the Iron Claws**.
- Rekha seems especially astute and potentially suspicious of the group.
## Next Steps
- Travel to **Milstrom** to follow George’s trail from Lonnie’s.
- Consider pursuing sabotage missions to support [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)’s race effort.
- Uncover more about Finnegan, the Night Boys, and the true aim of Project Purple Patch.
