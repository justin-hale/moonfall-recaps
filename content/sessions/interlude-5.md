## Session Overview

The party continues their journey through **The Hollow** swamp, pursuing the final item needed to help **Toonlock** against **Crowley's** assault on his realm. Their destination: the **Wichita Sisters**, who possess a mystical dagger required to complete their mission.

## The Fork in the Road

After surviving the peryton attack and bog wights from the previous session, the party encounters a crucial decision point where the path splits:

- **Option 1**: Several boats tied to trees at the edge of a deep body of water, offering a direct route across
- **Option 2**: A path leading into thick, magically opaque fog

### Helisanna's Deception

**[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** investigates the boats (rolling 14) and determines they appear seaworthy with no obvious holes or damage. However, **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** immediately claims the boats are "obviously sinking" and rolls an impressive **26 on deception**, convincing most of the party that the boats are unsafe.

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** attempts to see through the deception with insight but fails to beat [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s roll. **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**, with his high perception, can clearly see the boats are floating perfectly fine, but the party trusts [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s dramatic assessment over his technical expertise.

## Journey Through the Magical Fog

### Rope Safety Measures

The party decides to enter the fog despite **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s** reservations. **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** provides 50 feet of rope, and they tie themselves together in a line with about 15 feet between each person:

**Marching Order**: [Jasper](/player-characters/jasper) → [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) → [Bru](/player-characters/bru) → [Red](/player-characters/red) → [Silas](/player-characters/silas) → [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth) → [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** ties the knots using his survival skills, creating what the DM describes as "boy scout quality" knots - reliable but not perfect.

### The Fear Effect

As the party enters the fog, they experience an eerie silence - no animals, no wind, complete opacity even for those with darkvision. The fog creates a supernatural dread that forces wisdom saving throws:

**Failed Saves** (overcome by terror and compulsion to flee):
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**: Attempts to run back down the path
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**: Also tries to escape, dragging [Red](/player-characters/red) behind him  
- **[Jasper](/player-characters/jasper)**: Becomes disoriented and tries to run into the swamp

**Successful Saves**: **[Red](/player-characters/red)**, **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)**, **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)**, and **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** maintain their composure.

### The Grappling Sequence

What follows is an extended grappling sequence as the unaffected party members try to restrain their panicked companions:

**[Red](/player-characters/red)'s Struggle**: Despite being a large Goliath, [Red](/player-characters/red) gets pulled along by **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** and **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** due to their coordinated panic (they're both pulling in the same direction). [Red](/player-characters/red) eventually manages to get to his feet with a dirty 20 athletics roll.

**[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s Wrestling Mastery**: **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** demonstrates exceptional wrestling skills, repeatedly defeating **[Jasper](/player-characters/jasper)** in opposed athletics checks with rolls including a natural 20. She maintains control throughout the encounter using what the party jokes are her "water aerobics" training benefits.

**Creative Solutions**: 
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** and **BoxBox** successfully capture **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** through coordinated grappling
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** attempts multiple grapples on **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** but fails repeatedly as he proves too slippery
- **[Red](/player-characters/red)** tries slapping **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** to snap him out of it (dealing 2 damage) but this only makes [Silas](/player-characters/silas) more panicked

### Breaking the Compulsion

**[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** uses **Message** to telepathically contact **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**, telling him "[Silas](/player-characters/silas), you're being charmed. Come back." Her persuasion roll of 21 allows **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** another wisdom save, which he passes, returning to normal.

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** then uses his **Psychic Phone** to contact **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**, rolling persuasion with a psychic die to reach 20 total. This grants **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** another wisdom save, which he initially fails (rolling 4) but uses inspiration to reroll, achieving 21 and breaking free of the effect.

## The Cliff Challenge

### The Boiling Waters

The party encounters another obstacle: a 30-foot wide stretch of bubbling, steaming water that proves to be highly acidic. When they throw a rock into it, it violently sizzles and dissolves, confirming the water is too dangerous to cross.

### Elspeth's Climb

The only option is scaling a 50-foot cliff face. **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** volunteers to climb first, using her daggers as climbing aids for advantage on athletics checks. Her climbing progress:
- **First check (Dirty 20)**: Climbs 10 feet successfully
- **Second check (19)**: Reaches 20 feet when spiders emerge from crevices
- **Combat interruption**: Six giant spiders attack her position
- **Post-combat**: Uses **Enhance Ability** on her strength and continues climbing
- **Final stretch**: Reaches the top safely

## Spider Combat Encounter

### The Ambush

Six **giant spiders** emerge from crevices in the cliff face, converging on **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** while she's vulnerable mid-climb. The encounter tests the party's ability to protect a teammate at range.

### Combat Highlights

**[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s Tactical Blasting**: Uses **Eldritch Blast** with **Repelling Blast** to knock spiders away from [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth), buying time and creating space.

**[Red](/player-characters/red)'s Projectile Mastery**: Throws his tomahawk at the spiders, rolling a natural 20 for a devastating critical hit (25 damage total), cleanly bisecting one spider. The axe returns to his hand thanks to **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s** recent **Returning** weapon infusion.

**[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s Ranged [Red](/player-characters/red)emption**: After previous sessions of poor marksmanship, [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) has an excellent showing:
- Natural 20 with her gun, eliminating one spider
- Follow-up shot for 8 damage to another spider
- Demonstrates her detective training is finally paying off

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)'s Precision Strikes**: Uses his psychic daggers to eliminate multiple spiders with sneak attacks, including dramatic finishing moves like daggers "right up its ass."

**[Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s Artillery Support**: Deploys his **Eldritch Cannon** in Force Ballista mode, providing consistent damage and tactical positioning with push effects.

### Combat Resolution

The party successfully eliminates all six spiders through coordinated ranged attacks, with the final spider attempting to flee but being gunned down before escape. **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** successfully reaches the top of the cliff without taking significant damage.

## The Rope Bridge Crossing

### Establishing the Route

**[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** secures a rope to a bridge post at the top of the cliff and throws it down for the others to climb. Her survival check of 17 (after using inspiration to reroll) creates a solid "boy scout quality" knot.

### Group Climbing Sequence

The 50-foot rope hangs about 3 feet above ground, requiring jumping for shorter party members:

**Climbing Results**:
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**: Dirty 20 - climbs easily despite his small size
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)**: 18 - solid performance  
- **[Jasper](/player-characters/jasper)**: Dirty 20 - excellent technique
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)**: Dirty 20 - smooth ascent
- **[Red](/player-characters/red)**: Natural 20 first roll, 13 second (takes 13) - clumsy spinning climb that embarrasses him
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**: Rolls poorly (around 3) and decides to tie the rope around his waist for the others to pull him up

### Testing the Returning Axe

**[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** tests his new infusion by having **[Red](/player-characters/red)** throw his axe over the cliff edge. The axe successfully returns to [Red](/player-characters/red)'s hand, though they discover an important limitation: the returning property only works for the attuned wielder, not just anyone who throws it.

### Bridge Crossing

The party examines the rope bridge carefully with perception checks. **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** and **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** both roll well (23 and high teens) and determine the bridge is structurally sound with no obvious traps or deterioration.

**[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** volunteers to cross first, strutting confidently across without incident. The rest of the party follows successfully, with the bridge easily supporting even **[Red](/player-characters/red)'s** considerable weight.

## Arrival at the Hollow

### The Cave of Ominous Portents

The party finally reaches their destination: a depression in the ground containing a cave entrance. The area is appropriately ominous:

**Environmental Details**:
- Large gnarled trees and boulders scattered around
- Misty, swampy atmosphere with limited visibility  
- Torches lit at the cave entrance
- A canopy of crossing branches overhead

**Goblin Skull Decorations**: Most disturbing to **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**, the cave entrance is lined with **goblin skulls** that somehow appear to be frowning rather than showing the typical skull "grin." The skulls look genuinely unhappy, suggesting these goblins died in distress.

**[Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s Reaction**: Despite the macabre display of his own species' remains, [Bru](/player-characters/bru) finds the cave entrance "cozier than that mansion we were in," showing his chaotic goblin sensibilities.

## Pre-Cave Preparations

### Party Status Check

The party assesses their readiness before entering:
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)**: Down 11 HP but functional
- **[Jasper](/player-characters/jasper)**: Near full health  
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)**: Full health
- **Others**: Generally in good condition
- **Decision**: Proceed without a short rest

### Red's Emboldening Bond

**[Red](/player-characters/red)** attempts to cast **Emboldening Bond** on three party members but encounters an unexpected problem: the spell requires the targets to be "willing creatures at peace with one another."

**The Friendship Test**: When asked mechanically whether she considers **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** and **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** friends, **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** reveals she views them as "employees" rather than friends, maintaining professional distance despite their shared dangers.

**Emotional Impact**: **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** is visibly hurt by this revelation, showing teary eyes at not being considered a friend. **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** maintains that she needs to "keep it professional."

**Spell Resolution**: **[Red](/player-characters/red)** ends up connecting only **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** and **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** with the bond, as **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s** refusal to consider them friends prevents her from benefiting.

## The Guardian Awakens

### The Hinox Revelation

As the party approaches within 30 feet of the cave entrance, what appeared to be a moss-covered boulder begins to stir. A **massive ogre-like creature** - described as similar to a **Hinox** from Breath of the Wild but with two eyes - slowly stands up.

**Physical Description**:
- Colossal size, covered in moss and dirt
- Two eyes (unlike the typical one-eyed Hinox)
- Vegetation and debris falling off as it moves
- Reaches over to uproot an entire tree to use as a club

**Cliffhanger Ending**: The session ends just as initiative is about to be rolled, with this massive guardian blocking their path to the **Wichita Sisters** and the dagger they desperately need.

## Character Development and Themes

### Trust and Deception

**[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s** successful deception about the boats highlights ongoing trust issues within the party. Her willingness to mislead her companions for unknown reasons raises questions about her reliability and decision-making.

### Professional vs. Personal Relationships

The revelation that **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** views her bandmates as employees rather than friends creates tension and hurt feelings, particularly affecting **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** who clearly desires closer relationships with his companions.

### Individual Competencies

The session showcases each character's growing expertise:
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s** wrestling and shooting skills
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)'s** stealth and precision combat abilities  
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)'s** climbing and technical problem-solving
- **[Red](/player-characters/red)'s** weapon throwing and supportive magic
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s** artillery and magical engineering

### Team Coordination

Despite interpersonal tensions, the party demonstrates excellent tactical coordination during the spider encounter, showing their growth as a combat unit even when personal relationships remain complicated.

## Ongoing Plot Threads

1. **The Wichita Sisters**: The party must still reach and negotiate with these mysterious figures for the dagger
2. **The Massive Guardian**: A significant combat encounter awaits before they can enter the cave
3. **Toonlock's War**: Time pressure continues as **Crowley** maintains his assault
4. **Party Dynamics**: **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s** emotional distance creates ongoing interpersonal challenges
5. **Crowley's Master Plan**: The completion of this third trial will determine their ability to help **Toonlock**

## Session Conclusion

This session effectively builds tension through environmental challenges, interpersonal drama, and escalating threats. The progression from deception through teamwork to revelation of deeper character issues creates a strong narrative arc, while the cliffhanger ending with the massive guardian promises an epic confrontation to begin the next session.

The party's journey through **The Hollow** demonstrates both their growing tactical sophistication and their ongoing struggles with trust and communication, setting up compelling conflicts both external (the guardian) and internal (friendship vs. professionalism) for future sessions.
