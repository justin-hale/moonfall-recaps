## Post-Temple Recovery

The session begins immediately after the party's victory over the corrupted shrine's guardians. Having defeated the **Lacuna** and the demon that was helping her, the party takes a much-needed short rest to recover from their injuries. The temple's protective wards have been restored, but their efforts have revealed a new challenge: a **crackling portal** has appeared beside the temple, showing shadows moving on the other side.

During the short rest:
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** provides bardic inspiration through her musical performance, with purple mist emanating from her axe toward party members
- **[Red](/player-characters/red)** uses **Balm of Peace** to heal the most injured party members
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** investigates the temple structure, discovering it was designed to create planar stability in the region

## The Shadowfell Portal Discovery

As the party recovers, they hear a familiar voice calling from beyond the crackling rift. **George**, [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s grandson, can be seen through the portal along with the other pilgrims, including **Father Jacob**. George calls out desperately:

*"Who's there? Can you hear me? We're trapped. The shadows twist and pulse around the rips."*

**[Red](/player-characters/red)'s religion check** (natural 20, total 25) reveals this is a rift to the **Shadowfell** - a bleak realm of perpetual twilight where emotions are dulled and hope is scarce. Prolonged exposure drains creatures of vitality and will to live. The pilgrims appear to be flickering between states, caught between realms.

Father Jacob warns that *"the rift must be closed, else Shadowfell will be open to our world."*

## Olivia's Impulsive Decision

Without hesitation or consultation with her party, **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** immediately responds to seeing George trapped. She uses **Divine Smite** to forcefully break open the rift, despite [Red](/player-characters/red) having Eleanor's portal-closing amulet that could have safely handled the situation.

This decision triggers immediate combat as shadows begin spilling through the enlarged rift.

## Shadow Combat Encounter

The party faces multiple types of shadow creatures emerging from the Shadowfell:

### **Enemy Forces**
- **Shadow Horde**: Multiple shadow creatures that function like minions (one hit kills)
- **The Haunt**: A powerful entity that can move through creatures and cause massive psychic damage
- **Wraith**: A dangerous undead creature with various resistances

### **Combat Highlights**

**Round 1:**
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** opens with **Thunderwave**, destroying one shadow but learning they have constitution saves
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** casts **Faerie Fire**, outlining the shadows in blue light and granting advantage on attacks
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** systematically destroys shadows with her axe and magic gun, killing three in one turn

**Round 2-3:**
- **The Haunt** moves through multiple party members, forcing wisdom saves and dealing massive psychic damage (33 damage, half on save)
- Both **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** and **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** are knocked unconscious by the haunt's devastating area attack
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** demonstrates impressive skill by eliminating all remaining shadows with a single curved psychic blade attack, using his enhanced capabilities

**Round 4-5:**
- **Eldoran Knight** arrives as reinforcement, healing [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth) for 15 points and dealing significant damage to enemies
- **[Red](/player-characters/red)** focuses on using Eleanor's amulet to close the portal, requiring concentration over multiple turns
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** provides consistent damage with his **Eldritch Cannon** (flamethrower variant)

**Final Rounds:**
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** switches to warlock abilities, using **Hex** and **Eldritch Blast** to eliminate the minor devil
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)**, after being revived, uses her divine abilities to devastating effect against the remaining enemies
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** delivers the killing blow to the wraith with her magic gun and **Green Flame Blade**

## Portal Closure and Rescue

**[Red](/player-characters/red)** successfully uses **Eleanor's amulet** to close the Shadowfell portal, weaving streams of white light like thread and needle to seal the rift. The shadows on the other side are trapped as the portal closes, and the pilgrims successfully escape to safety.

## Reunion and Revelations

The emotional reunion between **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** and **George** reveals several important details:

### **George's Activities**
- He has been working with the **Twilight Company** on **Project Purple Patch**
- His mission involved investigating and closing Shadowfell rifts in the mountain region
- He was part of Father Jacob's pilgrim group attempting to seal the rift
- George has been learning various skills from a mentor named **Finnegan**, including cocktail making and lockpicking

### **Character Dynamics**
- [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) is both relieved and concerned about George's involvement with the "shady" Twilight Company
- George defends the organization, saying they're working against the Empire
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** pickpockets 5 gold from George during the reunion, then returns it as a "test" of George's awareness

## The Eldoran Knight Encounter

The party interacts with the **Eric, Eldoran Knight** who helped during combat. She wears the characteristic gem-embedded armor but her crystals appear dull and blackened rather than bright:

### **Knight's Background**
- She was sent on a mission to combat Shadowfell incursions
- Represents the **Order of Eldora** and their ongoing military operations
- Expresses the Empire's religious supremacist views about extinguishing other gods

### **Reward Negotiation**
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** negotiates for material compensation (rolling 24 on persuasion)
- The knight provides **10 gold total** and offers a recommendation in Eldora
- She shares information about the **High Forge dragon attack**, confirming the city's destruction
- Reveals that Eldoran forces fought the dragons but suffered casualties

### **Religious Tensions**
Eric espouses disturbing views about religious warfare:
*"It has become clear to us over the last century that we must extinguish other gods to gain validity in our own religion."*

This leads to pointed criticism from the party about forced conversions and religious persecution.

## Journey to Jeremy's House

The party decides to head down the mountain to **Jeremy the shepherd's** house for rest and warmth. During the journey:

### **Travel Arrangements**
- Multiple people ride Jeremy's magical sheep (the three dimensional-shifting lambs)
- **Kevin** ([Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s minion) rides with the small party members
- The **Eldoran Knight** struggles with her summoned war horse on the mountain terrain

### **[Red](/player-characters/red)'s Heritage Discussion**
- The party discusses **[Red](/player-characters/red)'s potential royal heritage** as prince of the **Skyhammer clan**
- His tattoos and the information from his mother's journal confirm his identity
- Plans are made to eventually seek out his people in the mountains

### **Brief Encounters**
- They pass **Eric** (the Eldoran knight from earlier) who was eating a magical dinner
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** mocks her equipment, noting her crystals are "smoky and dull" unlike typical Eldoran gear

## Rest at Jeremy's Cottage

The party reaches **Jeremy's cottage** where they prepare for a long rest:

### **Accommodation**
- The cottage is cramped but warm
- Pilgrims set up in the barn while the party stays in the house
- **Jeremy** offers hospitality despite the crowded conditions

### **Evening Activities**
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** spends the evening tinkering and fixing Jeremy's broken furniture and dishes
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** plays casual guitar, with purple energy strands emanating into the environment and even the ground
- **Radio broadcasts** provide news about **Astral Dragons** heading toward their world and recruitment for the "Eldoran Space Force"

## The Moon's Destruction

The session ends with a catastrophic revelation during **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s** night watch:

### **The Cosmic Event**
While keeping watch due to his **Alert** feat, **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** hears crackling sounds like magma and glass grinding coming from space. Looking up, he witnesses:

- **Cracks appearing in the real moon**, lighting up with magma
- A **massive female figure** larger than the sky falling toward their world
- The **moon exploding completely**
- An **eardrum-shattering scream** accompanying the celestial destruction

This apocalyptic event suggests that while they still have the artificial Eldoran moon, the destruction of the natural moon will have profound consequences for their world.

## Character Development and Themes

### **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s Impulsiveness**
[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)'s immediate action to save George without consulting the party demonstrates her deep family loyalty but also her tendency toward decisive, potentially dangerous action.

### **Religious and Political Tensions**
The session reinforces themes about religious extremism and imperial expansion through the Eldoran knight's disturbing views on theological supremacy.

### **Escalating Cosmic Threats**
The progression from local demon problems to dragons attacking cities to moon destruction shows the campaign's scope expanding to cosmic-level threats.

### **Family and Loyalty**
The George rescue subplot emphasizes family bonds and the lengths characters will go to protect loved ones, while also showing generational differences in approach to resistance movements.

## Loot and Mechanical Notes

- **10 gold total** from the Eldoran knight
- **Long rest** achieved, allowing the party to reach **Level 6**
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** gains new **infusions** and continues developing his minion army
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** notes achieving **Reliable Talent** with his level advancement

## Ongoing Plot Threads

1. **The destroyed moon's consequences** for tides, lycanthropy, and cosmic balance
2. **[Red](/player-characters/red)'s royal heritage** and potential connections to mountain clans
3. **Escalating planar instability** with multiple rift incidents
4. **Twilight Company operations** and their broader resistance network
5. **Eldoran expansion** and religious persecution campaigns
6. **Astral Dragon threats** requiring space-based military response
7. **Jeremy's mysterious background** as a former vampire hunter

The session masterfully balances character development, family drama, cosmic horror, and political commentary while advancing multiple plot threads toward what appears to be an apocalyptic climax involving the destruction of fundamental celestial bodies.
