## 🎭 Major Events
### Olivia's Solo Investigations
- [Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia) investigates Finnegan's Bakery, finding it suspiciously closed and hastily abandoned. She connects its sudden closure to the disappearance of a local figure and the growing dragon threat.
- She then visits Bo Dega, who is also shutting down his shop due to fear of approaching dragons. [Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia) arranges for Bo Dega and his cat to join the group's caravan, securing supplies and shelter.
### Group Reconvenes Over Breakfast
- The group finally gathers and shares scattered info: dragons are real, approaching the city, and causing mass evacuations. This catches several members off guard.
- There is light-hearted bickering about the concert from the night before and whose actions were most impactful, with multiple characters claiming credit.
- Tensions briefly rise between [Silas](/player-characters/Silas) and Brew, and [Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna) is teased for her subpar performance.
### Planning for the Race
- The group solidifies roles in the upcoming underground street race:
  - **[Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)** will drive the Doomfall.
  - **BoxBox** (her automaton) rides in the back for support.
  - **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** and **[Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna)** prepare sabotage and distraction tactics.
  - **Brew** equips and plans the use of flamethrower cannons and caltrops.
  - **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** and **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** offer support roles including healing, driving, and cannon operation.
- Tactical positions and sabotage plans are laid out, including:
  - Trapping the narrow tunnel with caltrops ([Silas](/player-characters/Silas)).
  - Stationing [Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna) at a key hairpin turn.
  - Using flamethrower turrets mounted on the van.
  - [Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia) staying atop the van as mobile cannon support.
### Final Pre-Race Errands
- [Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth) visits rival racer Divald to exchange small talk and gather intel.
- [Silas](/player-characters/Silas) collects payment from Twilight Company for prior sabotage work.
- Brew attempts to steal a communal liquor bottle in a failed scheme to poison rival racers — accidentally disrupting [Silas](/player-characters/Silas)’ own sabotage plan.
## 🏎️ The Race Begins
- [Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth) lines up with nearly 50 racers. The team’s pre-race support is visualized as a surreal, symbolic combat encounter representing “the race” as a sentient monster.
- Players alternate between skill checks and combat mechanics in a shared narrative framework, effectively “fighting” the dangers of the race.
### Skill Challenge Highlights:
- [Silas](/player-characters/Silas) expertly lays caltrops in the tunnel.
- [Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia) intimidates a goblin team into vacating a key ambush spot.
- [Red](/player-characters/Red) casts buffs and support magic like Emboldening Bond.
- Brew fires fireworks from roof-mounted cannons to detonate landmines.
- [Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth) benefits from multiple buffs (Cat’s Grace, Sanctuary, Shield of Faith) while dodging traps and maintaining high speed.
## 💥 Combat with the "Race"
- The “Race” manifests as a mechanical, mobile nightmare that targets [Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth).
- The party tactically overwhelms it using positioning, teamwork, and abilities like Hex, Smite, and psychic knives.
- [Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia) lands a decisive hit with Divine Smite.
- [Silas](/player-characters/Silas) and [Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna) deal significant damage, while [Red](/player-characters/Red) and Brew offer key support.
## 🏁 Victory
- [Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth) overtakes the final racers using a clever fake-out maneuver and finishes with a jump across the final bridge — Fast & Furious-style.
- She's awarded first place and a membership into the underground racing circuit.
- Just as the dust settles, dragons begin their assault on the city.
