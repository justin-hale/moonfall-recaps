## 🎭 Major Events
### Olivia's Solo Investigations
- Olivia investigates Finnegan's Bakery, finding it suspiciously closed and hastily abandoned. She connects its sudden closure to the disappearance of a local figure and the growing dragon threat.
- She then visits Bo Dega, who is also shutting down his shop due to fear of approaching dragons. Olivia arranges for Bo Dega and his cat to join the group's caravan, securing supplies and shelter.
### Group Reconvenes Over Breakfast
- The group finally gathers and shares scattered info: dragons are real, approaching the city, and causing mass evacuations. This catches several members off guard.
- There is light-hearted bickering about the concert from the night before and whose actions were most impactful, with multiple characters claiming credit.
- Tensions briefly rise between Silas and Brew, and Helisanna is teased for her subpar performance.
### Planning for the Race
- The group solidifies roles in the upcoming underground street race:
  - **Elspeth** will drive the Doomfall.
  - **BoxBox** (her automaton) rides in the back for support.
  - **Silas** and **Helisanna** prepare sabotage and distraction tactics.
  - **Brew** equips and plans the use of flamethrower cannons and caltrops.
  - **Red** and **Olivia** offer support roles including healing, driving, and cannon operation.
- Tactical positions and sabotage plans are laid out, including:
  - Trapping the narrow tunnel with caltrops (Silas).
  - Stationing Helisanna at a key hairpin turn.
  - Using flamethrower turrets mounted on the van.
  - Olivia staying atop the van as mobile cannon support.
### Final Pre-Race Errands
- Elspeth visits rival racer Divald to exchange small talk and gather intel.
- Silas collects payment from Twilight Company for prior sabotage work.
- Brew attempts to steal a communal liquor bottle in a failed scheme to poison rival racers — accidentally disrupting Silas’ own sabotage plan.
## 🏎️ The Race Begins
- Elspeth lines up with nearly 50 racers. The team’s pre-race support is visualized as a surreal, symbolic combat encounter representing “the race” as a sentient monster.
- Players alternate between skill checks and combat mechanics in a shared narrative framework, effectively “fighting” the dangers of the race.
### Skill Challenge Highlights:
- Silas expertly lays caltrops in the tunnel.
- Olivia intimidates a goblin team into vacating a key ambush spot.
- Red casts buffs and support magic like Emboldening Bond.
- Brew fires fireworks from roof-mounted cannons to detonate landmines.
- Elspeth benefits from multiple buffs (Cat’s Grace, Sanctuary, Shield of Faith) while dodging traps and maintaining high speed.
## 💥 Combat with the "Race"
- The “Race” manifests as a mechanical, mobile nightmare that targets Elspeth.
- The party tactically overwhelms it using positioning, teamwork, and abilities like Hex, Smite, and psychic knives.
- Olivia lands a decisive hit with Divine Smite.
- Silas and Helisanna deal significant damage, while Red and Brew offer key support.
## 🏁 Victory
- Elspeth overtakes the final racers using a clever fake-out maneuver and finishes with a jump across the final bridge — Fast & Furious-style.
- She's awarded first place and a membership into the underground racing circuit.
- Just as the dust settles, dragons begin their assault on the city.
