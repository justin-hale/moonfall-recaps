## Opening: Arrival on the Mountain

The session begins with the party being transported by Marcus through a portal, emerging on a cold, snowy mountaintop outside a cave. A bitter blizzard whips around them, but their magical sheep wool cloaks (from their previous adventure) provide protection. Everyone except **[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)** successfully makes their constitution saves against the harsh weather, leaving him with disadvantage on dexterity saves until **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** gives him Magnolia's warm blanket.

## The Eldoran Attack

### Sounds of Battle

Through the blizzard, the party hears horn blasts and commotion from a nearby Goliath village. **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)'s** high perception allows him to spot people running from a point of light - a figure in glowing armor. With exceptional perception rolls, the party identifies the figure as **Eric**, the Eldoran Knight they had encountered previously, now wielding a sword and cutting down Goliath guards.

**[Red](/player-characters/Red)'s** enhanced sensors (as he's still connected to the spaceship systems) reveal that Eldoran soldiers had planted explosives to trigger the avalanche, and more soldiers are approaching from two hours away.

### Jasper's Choice

As Eric approaches, she calls out to **[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)**: "[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)! Help me kill these infidels!" However, [Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper) makes a crucial moral choice, shouting back "I won't let you kill them" and charging to attack Eric instead of joining her. This moment solidifies [Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)'s allegiance with the party against the Eldoran Empire.

### Combat Preparation

The party prepares for battle with **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** casting **Emboldening Bond** on [Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper), [Silas](/player-characters/Silas), and [Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia), while also providing **Bless** to give them additional d4 bonuses. **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** uses exceptional stealth (rolling 30) to position himself for sneak attacks.

## Red's Ultimate Choice

### The Spaceship Dilemma

With an avalanche approaching in three rounds and Eric attacking, **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** faces a critical decision. He can either:
- Stay in flight mode and launch the spaceship in three rounds
- Transform into terrestrial/robot mode to fight but delay the launch

The Elder desperately calls for [Red](/player-characters/Red) to enter the special chamber, explaining it's "his destiny" as a Skyhammer to power the ship.

### The Transformation

Despite the party's concerns and limited understanding of what will happen, **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** chooses to enter the humanoid-shaped chamber. The process is described as invasive, with ports connecting directly to his spine and neural system. [Red](/player-characters/Red) undergoes a horrifying transformation where his consciousness slowly merges with the spaceship, feeling "piece by piece transition from this fleshy body to something very large, semi-inorganic."

**[Red](/player-characters/Red)** emerges as a massive robot form but quickly realizes he's losing control to the ship's systems, warning his friends: "I don't think I'm in control anymore. I feel as though the spaceship has taken over me and not me the ship."

## The Battle with Eric

### Eric's Enhanced State

Eric reveals she has taken the mysterious eye-drop drug (the "V" substance), significantly enhancing her speed and combat abilities. She demonstrates devastating combat prowess with multiple attacks per turn and legendary actions.

### Party Coordination

The battle showcases excellent teamwork:

- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna)** successfully uses the new **Sleep** spell, incapacitating Eric temporarily
- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** provides consistent sneak attack damage from stealth positions  
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** delivers devastating critical hits with **Divine Smite**, dealing 47 damage in one attack
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)** contributes solid ranged damage with her magical gun
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** uses **Color Spray** through Kevin to blind Eric, providing advantage for all attacks

### The Emboldening Bond Heroics

The party makes dramatic use of [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s **Emboldening Bond** ability, with party members teleporting to intercept attacks meant for dying allies:
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** teleports to save **[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)** from a killing blow
- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** later saves **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** from a devastating area attack, using his **Evasion** ability to take no damage

### Eric's Desperation

As the battle turns against her, Eric becomes increasingly desperate, using multiple legendary actions and powerful area attacks. Her final shockwave attack nearly kills multiple party members before **[Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna)** delivers the killing blow with an enhanced **Eldritch Blast**, described as a "Super Saiyan-esque" double-handed blast while under the influence of the eye-drop drug.

## The Tragic Revelation

### Red's Permanent Transformation

After the battle, the party discovers the horrifying truth: **[Red](/player-characters/Red)** cannot be safely removed from the spaceship. When they attempt to communicate with him, they receive mixed signals - sometimes it sounds like [Red](/player-characters/Red), sometimes like an artificial intelligence that merely uses his voice patterns.

**[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** attempts to engineer a solution, rolling a natural 20 on Arcana to understand the situation. However, even with his exceptional skill, he realizes that removing [Red](/player-characters/Red) would likely kill him or leave him in a state "worse than death."

### The Ship's Explanation

The spaceship/[Red](/player-characters/Red) entity reveals disturbing information:
- [Red](/player-characters/Red) is permanently integrated with the ship
- While [Red](/player-characters/Red) chose to enter the chamber, he was not fully informed of the consequences  
- The transformation cannot be reversed without destroying [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s organic form
- The original [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s consciousness experienced "horrible pain" during the process

### Bru's Violent Response

Overcome with grief and rage, **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** confronts the Elder who orchestrated [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s sacrifice. Despite [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s pleas for restraint, [Bru](/player-characters/Bru) stabs the Elder in the gut and whispers a threat: "You have made an enemy of all goblins. If you see another goblin, prepare to die."

## Departure and Aftermath

### Leaving the Goliaths

The party makes the difficult decision to leave the spaceship and the Goliath clan behind. They refuse to join the space colonization mission, both because they don't want to abandon their world and because they're disgusted by how the Goliaths treated [Red](/player-characters/Red).

**[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)** chooses to accompany the party, officially breaking with the Eldoran Empire and joining their group permanently.

### The Sleigh Escape

Using their artifice skills, **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** and **[Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)** construct an impressive sleigh powered by their magical sheep and **Bob the ram**. They ransack the Goliath compound, stealing advanced technology and Eric's crystal-embedded armor and weapons.

### Return to Milstrom

The party makes excellent time down the mountain and returns to **Milstrom**, [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s adoptive hometown. They reunite with their vehicles (the Vroomfall and Doomfall) and take a much-needed long rest.

## Character Development and Gifts

### Memorial Preparations

The party spends the evening drinking and reminiscing about [Red](/player-characters/Red), planning some form of memorial service. **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** creates magical tattoos as tributes:

- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)** receives a **Spell Wrought Tattoo** with a first-level spell, designed as a memorial to [Red](/player-characters/Red)
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** plans to give himself a similar tattoo
- The tattoos serve as permanent reminders of their lost friend

### Equipment Upgrades

**[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** presents **[Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia)** with a **Propulsion Shield** - a magical shield that pushes attackers away when she's hit, designed to help protect her during her tendency to charge into melee combat.

### Jasper's Integration

**[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)** fully integrates with the party, sharing their grief over [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s loss and demonstrating his commitment to their cause over the Empire's. His decision to fight Eric instead of the party proves his loyalty and moral character.

## Session Themes and Impact

### Sacrifice and Loss

This session explores the heavy theme of sacrifice, particularly when someone makes a decision without fully understanding the consequences. [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s transformation raises questions about informed consent and the expectations placed on leaders or "chosen ones."

### Moral Complexity

The Elder's perspective that [Red](/player-characters/Red) made a "heroic sacrifice" contrasts sharply with the party's view that [Red](/player-characters/Red) was manipulated and betrayed. The session doesn't provide easy answers about whether the sacrifice was justified.

### Found Family

The party's devastation over losing [Red](/player-characters/Red) demonstrates how much they've grown as a found family. Their refusal to abandon him, even when it means opposing an entire clan, shows the strength of their bonds.

### Political Awakening

**[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)'s** choice to side against the Empire represents a significant political moment, showing how individual relationships can overcome institutional loyalty.

## Ongoing Plot Threads

1. **[Red](/player-characters/Red)'s Fate**: While [Red](/player-characters/Red) is effectively gone as a player character, his consciousness might still exist within the spaceship
2. **Anti-Goliath Sentiment**: **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** has declared all Goliaths his enemies, potentially affecting future encounters
3. **Eldoran Technology**: The party has acquired advanced crystal-powered equipment
4. **[Jasper](/player-characters/Jasper)'s Integration**: The former Eldoran soldier must find his place within the group
5. **The Space Colony**: The Goliath spaceship represents an ongoing threat or potential ally
6. **Returning to High Forge**: The party prepares to return to their original destination

## Session Conclusion

This session serves as a major turning point in the campaign, permanently altering the party composition and establishing **[Red](/player-characters/Red)'s** sacrifice as a defining moment for the group. The combination of intense combat, emotional character development, and difficult moral choices creates one of the campaign's most impactful episodes.

The party emerges from this experience more tightly bonded but also carrying the trauma of being unable to save their friend. Their hatred for the Goliaths who orchestrated [Red](/player-characters/Red)'s sacrifice will likely influence future story decisions and character relationships.

**Zach's** departure as [Red](/player-characters/Red) is handled with appropriate gravity, giving the character a meaningful end that serves the story while providing closure for both the player and the remaining party members.
