**Location:** High Forge, Market Ward – “The Cog and Steam” Tavern
### Party Members
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna) Doomfall** – Electric lute-playing bard and frontwoman of Doomfall.
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** – Scheming halfling rogue and manager of the band.
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** – Goblin artificer and chaos gremlin with a flair for pyrotechnics.
- **[Red](/player-characters/red) (formerly Blue)** – Goliath cleric, pacifist healer, and protector.
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** – Elderly paladin with a cop-like sense of justice.
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** – Artificer gunslinger with a mechanical companion, BoxBox.
### Opening Scene: Chaos at the Tavern
The party is split between eating dinner and running a shell game when a Goliath barges into the Cog and Steam tavern shouting about “Bartley P. Thatch.” Chaos breaks out:
- A beer stein brains the Goliath.
- A full-on brawl begins.
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** magically engineers fart-scented peanuts and lobs them into the crowd.
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** tries to intimidate the crowd but is punched and takes 4 damage.
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** steals 10 silver during the commotion and stealths away.
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)** tries to back [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) up with intimidation and BoxBox tackles a brawler.
- **[Red](/player-characters/red)** nervously assesses the situation and casts Guidance on [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia).
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** sets off a fireworks cannon that creates fire-show chaos, followed by him throwing chairs and shouting “Fire!” while Kevin runs around screaming.
Eventually, the tavern clears out thanks to a fire suppression system and [Olivia](/player-characters/olivia) and [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)’s crowd control. They leave the tavern in disarray.
### Post-Brawl: Recruitment Offer
Outside, a figure named **Dirk** from the **Stephen Guild** offers the party a job:
- Guard a caravan along the Gold Road to Eldoran.
- 500 gold for the job.
- Meeting time: 6 AM at the Garages Café near the caravan bays.
The group is noncommittal and skeptical about the rate.
### Evening Activities
The party splits up:
### 🎸 [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)
- Investigates **The Little Hovel**, a dive metal club.
- Signs up to perform a set at 1 AM after scoping out terrible opening acts.
- Gains the attention of **Sandra Talks**, a sharply dressed talent agent scouting for a show.
### 🎲 [Silas](/player-characters/silas) & [Bru](/player-characters/bru)
- Run a card cheating scam on local gamblers.
- [Bru](/player-characters/bru) acts as spotter (poorly); [Silas](/player-characters/silas) uses psychic dice and sleight of hand to win big.
- They win enough gold to buy burgers and reflect on their sloppy success.
### 🕶️ [Red](/player-characters/red) & [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)
- Tag along to the Little Hovel to watch over the group.
- [Red](/player-characters/red) awkwardly wallflowers but eventually joins the others near the stage.
- [Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth) probes for underground racing contacts but doesn’t find much.
### Concert of the Century
[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna) headlines the final act at The Little Hovel with support from [Bru](/player-characters/bru) and [Red](/player-characters/red):
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** engineers stage pyrotechnics synced to the set.
- **[Red](/player-characters/red)** uses Thaumaturgy to enhance the flames with purple coloration.
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** delivers a transcendent metal performance enhanced by Guidance and Enhance Ability from [Red](/player-characters/red).
- Audience members’ eyes glow purple, magic fills the air, and a surreal, euphoric concert atmosphere takes over.
- Performance rolls exceed 24. The show is an unforgettable success.
### Massive Payday
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** negotiates a last-minute, high-profile gig with Sandra Talks for **10,000 gold**:
- 1,000 gold up front in a suitcase.
- 6,000 upon arrival at the show.
- 3,000 after the show.
- The group is now flush with resources, contemplating splitting the gold and debating tour logistics (stay in van or book lodging).
### Cliffhanger & Next Steps
- The group has conflicting commitments: a 6 AM meeting with Dirk and a high-paying concert the next night.
- They are now recognized as elite talent and might have choices to make between fame and duty.
