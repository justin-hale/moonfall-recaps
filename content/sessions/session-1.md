**Location:** High Forge, Market Ward ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Cog and Steam‚Äù Tavern
### Party Members
- **Helisanna Doomfall** ‚Äì Electric lute-playing bard and frontwoman of Doomfall.
- **Silas** ‚Äì Scheming halfling rogue and manager of the band.
- **Bru** ‚Äì Goblin artificer and chaos gremlin with a flair for pyrotechnics.
- **Red (formerly Blue)** ‚Äì Goliath cleric, pacifist healer, and protector.
- **Olivia** ‚Äì Elderly paladin with a cop-like sense of justice.
- **Elspeth** ‚Äì Artificer gunslinger with a mechanical companion, BoxBox.
### Opening Scene: Chaos at the Tavern
The party is split between eating dinner and running a shell game when a Goliath barges into the Cog and Steam tavern shouting about ‚ÄúBartley P. Thatch.‚Äù Chaos breaks out:
- A beer stein brains the Goliath.
- A full-on brawl begins.
- **Bru** magically engineers fart-scented peanuts and lobs them into the crowd.
- **Olivia** tries to intimidate the crowd but is punched and takes 4 damage.
- **Silas** steals 10 silver during the commotion and stealths away.
- **Elspeth** tries to back Olivia up with intimidation and BoxBox tackles a brawler.
- **Red** nervously assesses the situation and casts Guidance on Olivia.
- **Bru** sets off a fireworks cannon that creates fire-show chaos, followed by him throwing chairs and shouting ‚ÄúFire!‚Äù while Kevin runs around screaming.
Eventually, the tavern clears out thanks to a fire suppression system and Olivia and Elspeth‚Äôs crowd control. They leave the tavern in disarray.
### Post-Brawl: Recruitment Offer
Outside, a figure named **Dirk** from the **Stephen Guild** offers the party a job:
- Guard a caravan along the Gold Road to Eldoran.
- 500 gold for the job.
- Meeting time: 6 AM at the Garages Caf√© near the caravan bays.
The group is noncommittal and skeptical about the rate.
### Evening Activities
The party splits up:
### üé∏ Helisanna
- Investigates **The Little Hovel**, a dive metal club.
- Signs up to perform a set at 1 AM after scoping out terrible opening acts.
- Gains the attention of **Sandra Talks**, a sharply dressed talent agent scouting for a show.
### üé≤ Silas & Bru
- Run a card cheating scam on local gamblers.
- Bru acts as spotter (poorly); Silas uses psychic dice and sleight of hand to win big.
- They win enough gold to buy burgers and reflect on their sloppy success.
### üï∂Ô∏è Red & Elspeth
- Tag along to the Little Hovel to watch over the group.
- Red awkwardly wallflowers but eventually joins the others near the stage.
- Elspeth probes for underground racing contacts but doesn‚Äôt find much.
### Concert of the Century
Helisanna headlines the final act at The Little Hovel with support from Bru and Red:
- **Bru** engineers stage pyrotechnics synced to the set.
- **Red** uses Thaumaturgy to enhance the flames with purple coloration.
- **Helisanna** delivers a transcendent metal performance enhanced by Guidance and Enhance Ability from Red.
- Audience members‚Äô eyes glow purple, magic fills the air, and a surreal, euphoric concert atmosphere takes over.
- Performance rolls exceed 24. The show is an unforgettable success.
### Massive Payday
- **Silas** negotiates a last-minute, high-profile gig with Sandra Talks for **10,000 gold**:
- 1,000 gold up front in a suitcase.
- 6,000 upon arrival at the show.
- 3,000 after the show.
- The group is now flush with resources, contemplating splitting the gold and debating tour logistics (stay in van or book lodging).
### Cliffhanger & Next Steps
- The group has conflicting commitments: a 6 AM meeting with Dirk and a high-paying concert the next night.
- They are now recognized as elite talent and might have choices to make between fame and duty.
