- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)** (later)

## Key Events
### 1. **Briefing at the Diner**
- [Silas](/player-characters/Silas) fills the team in on sabotage plans targeting [Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)’s car.
- Twilight Company wants them to sabotage rival cars in Bay 10 and Bay 12.
- After paying for a meal and some banter with a chameleon-accented waitress, the group heads to the garage.
### 2. **Surprise in the Van**
- Upon checking the garage and [Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)’s bay, the party hears noises in their van.
- They discover three gnomes inside assembling a bomb.
- Combat breaks out: two gnomes are killed (via Eldritch Blast and melee), one is stabilized and captured.
### 3. **Interrogating Philbin**
- Philbin reveals they were hired anonymously at "Arby’s" to sabotage the party’s car.
- He claims ignorance of the benefactor's identity, describing them only as hooded and threatening.
### 4. **Resurrecting the Gnomes**
- [Red](/player-characters/Red) escorts the injured gnomes to a Temple of Tyr.
- An old cleric revives them.
- The party coerces the gnomes to finish the bomb and repurpose it to sabotage Bay 10’s car.
### 5. **Sabotage Missions**
- **Bay 10**: [Silas](/player-characters/Silas) plants the finished bomb under a racecar while [Helisanna](/player-characters/Helisanna) distracts guards with a dramatic act.
- **Bay 12**: [Silas](/player-characters/Silas) and [Bru](/player-characters/Bru) sneak in. [Bru](/player-characters/Bru) welds the exhaust closed using artificer tools and spells. [Silas](/player-characters/Silas) stalls a suspicious dwarf with flirtation and misdirection.

## Memorable Moments
- **“Castle Doctrine”** humorously invoked to justify murder in their own garage.
- **Philbin’s whining** becomes a running gag.
- **[Silas](/player-characters/Silas)’ seduction attempt** of a dwarf is absurdly effective.
- **[Bru](/player-characters/Bru)’s sabotage** using artificer ingenuity.
- **Arby’s as a hub** for underground dealings—ironic given its mundane facade.
## Ongoing Threads
- **Mystery of the benefactor** behind the gnome saboteurs.
- **Who is trying to sabotage [Elspeth](/player-characters/Elspeth)?** Is it connected to the Twilight Company?
- **The Briefcase**: Mentioned to be with [Olivia](/player-characters/Olivia); possibly a future plot thread.
- **Arby’s stakeout**: The group may continue to investigate there.

## Closing
