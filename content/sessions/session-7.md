## Escape From the Race and Into the Fire

The session begins immediately after the conclusion of the race, with the party still in the Vroomfall. Suddenly, explosions are heard from the direction of the Market Ward — possibly indicating a dragon attack. The party, joined by Elspeth who loads her car into the Vroomfall, quickly debates their escape route from the city.

## Plotting a Tunnel Escape

They consider taking the old, secret tunnels beneath the city, once used by royalty and now largely forgotten. Though none of them are experts, Olivia recalls encountering smugglers who may have used the tunnels, and Bru and Silas speculate that their Twilight Company contact Victor may know a way out. However, Little Hovel, where Victor might be, is in the Market Ward — the area currently under siege.

With no better options, the party resolves to head toward the chaos to rescue Victor. Olivia also remembers that Bodega, her great-grandson, is at her apartment, which is along the way.

## Driving Into the Market Ward

They begin the drive into the Market Ward against the flow of traffic. Guards at the gate are shocked but let them through. As they enter, they see dragons dive-bombing buildings, fireballs raining down, and a glowing golden magical dome protecting thousands of citizens. Jasper spots golden-armored soldiers forming this protective bubble using connected crystal shields — not High Forge soldiers, possibly Eldoran in origin.

## Picking Up Victor and Bodega

In the chaos, Elspeth is sent to retrieve Bodega separately. The rest of the party drives to Little Hovel, dodging dragon fire via group dexterity saves (blessed and bard-inspired), taking fire damage along the way. They finally find Victor, frantically trying to rescue a mix of essential and ridiculous items — including Girl Scout cookies, a piranha gun, and a folder of old tunnel maps (which he does not realize are valuable).

Victor is roped into the van and interrogated. He reveals he doesn’t know the tunnels himself but has the folder full of mining routes — potentially useful to navigate out. Olivia grabs it, and the group continues the escape.

## More Fire, More Problems

Another fireball comes close, prompting another save. Red casts *Prayer of Healing* to top up the injured party. As they head back toward the gate to exit the Market Ward, one dragon clamps onto it, partially holding it open. The party debates using distractions and illusions to slip by. They attempt a combo: Helisanna casts *Minor Illusion* of a golden knight while Bru fires his Force Ballista. The illusion nearly works, but the dragon sees through it and retaliates.

A successful round of saves and creative buffs lets them survive the hit. Red lays on hands to keep people stable. They blast through the gate — just barely making it as the dragon claws into the Great Hall.

## Into the Mines

Inside the now-empty Great Hall, the party heads for the mine entrance. They hear Victor’s sending stone ring and eavesdrop on a call from Twilight Company associate Mira, who informs them the Iron Claws gang is controlling tunnel access and charging fees. Olivia realizes that Helja Ungart, the gang's leader, is an old nemesis who would definitely recognize her — and Silas too, who is now revealed to have stolen a mysterious object from her.

## The Stolen Orb

Silas produces a swirling, galaxy-filled glass orb, the object of the heist that cost his former crew their lives. Victor calls it a communication device to another plane or being. Olivia touches it — sees a cosmic dragon-like being, and hears it speak her name. She takes psychic damage but learns it knows her deeply.

The party debates where to hide the orb, almost placing it in the bag of holding before recalling that could risk catastrophic dimensional collapse. It's safely returned to a regular pack.

## Plans and Disguises

At the aquafarm near the tunnel entrance, they rendezvous with Bodega and the Twilight Company crew (Cyrus, Mira, Lanny, Courtney). The party prepares to sneak past the Iron Claws with a multi-layered plan:
- Paint the Vroomfall to disguise it.
- Use disguise kits on the more recognizable members.
- Hide Red and Silas in the bag of holding (without the orb).
- Hide Helisanna, Elspeth, and Brew in produce crates.

During prep, they discover the Twilight Company's crates are full of an illegal drug called "V" — a red liquid taken as eyedrops. Olivia demands they abandon the cargo or use it as bribe material. Lanny and Courtney reluctantly agree and sink the crates in the hydroponic lake.

## Crossing the Checkpoint

With all disguises prepped, Olivia leads the caravan to the checkpoint, supported by Bo. A tough negotiation ensues with the Iron Claw thugs, who demand 500 gold. Olivia successfully persuades them to accept 450, and the party moves through safely.

## The Long March and Freedom

They drive for hours through guarded tunnel paths, finally emerging onto the other side of the mountain under a sky of stars. The escape is successful. Victor is overjoyed; Olivia sternly warns Bo this is his one and only pass for getting involved in crime.

## Endgame and Reflections

The party plans to continue toward their next job. Loose ends:
- The orb is powerful and mysterious — potentially a link to a divine being or dragon.
- Silas has a bounty on his head and a past with Helja.
- Olivia’s grandson is still missing, and their journey will lead them closer to that mystery.
- Red, Helisanna, and Elspeth all have reasons to move forward toward the next city.

As the session ends, they prepare to meet their escort at the upcoming rendezvous point, disguises intact, dragon behind them, and dangers still ahead.
