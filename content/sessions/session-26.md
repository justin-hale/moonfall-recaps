## Session Overview

The party successfully infiltrates High Forge using their magical paint to create new tunnel routes, rescues Lark's family from Iron Claws custody, and discovers the resistance headquarters located dangerously close to a massive underground rave populated by [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s purple-eyed followers.

## Pre-Mission Planning

### Cover Identities and Disguises

The party establishes fake identities for their infiltration mission:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)**: "Borat Yeltsin"
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)**: "Poor Valley" 
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)**: "I Literally Don't Care" (shortened to "Litter")
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)**: "The Granny"
- **[Elspeth](/player-characters/elspeth)**: "Bangers and Mash" (assigned in her absence)

**Disguise Preparations**:
- **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** uses his disguise kit extensively - eyepatch, facial hair, scar across nose
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** covers his green goblin skin with human-tone makeup
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** wears bright pink clothing instead of her usual black attire
- **[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** goes full "ultra grandma" with crocheted shawls and knitting needles over her plate armor

### The Magical Paint Solution

The party discovers they can use **Scarlett's magical paint** to alter their tunnel map and create new passages through reality:
- **Lark** provides detailed tunnel maps with Iron Claws patrol routes
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** draws new tunnel entrances using the magical paint (having the best performance skill)
- They create a hidden garage entrance for their vehicles (Vroomfall and Doomfall)
- A direct route to the residential hall where Lark's family is being held

## The Jackals Encounter

### Mistaken Identity

While traveling toward High Forge, the party encounters another group of **Jackal bounty hunters** who mistake them for fellow hunters:
- The hunters recognize the painted Vroomfall and assume they're collecting on Taco Cat's bounty
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** plays along, pretending they captured the targets
- When the deception unravels, the hunters threaten retaliation before driving away

## Underground Wrestling Match

### Meeting [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) Kapua

In the tunnels beneath High Forge, the party discovers a massive underground wrestling event:
- **Bebop and Rocksteady** (warthog and rhinoceros champions) face a mysterious challenger
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) Kapua**, a turtle monk in disguise, enters as the underdog fighter
- **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** and **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** immediately begin running betting scams with fake aliases

### The Epic Wrestling Match

**[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** demonstrates impressive martial arts skills:
- Uses **Step of the Wind** to dodge the champions' coordinated attacks
- Employs **Deflect Attacks** to turn their signature move against them
- Performs a spectacular finishing move: bouncing off the ropes 32 feet into the air and delivering a devastating shell drop attack
- Defeats both champions decisively, shocking the crowd and bankrupting bookmakers

### Post-Match Pursuit

After **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)'s** spectacular victory, **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** and **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** chase after **Quick Coin Quinn** to collect their betting winnings:
- Quinn is trying to avoid paying out the massive winnings from the upset victory
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** recognizes **[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** and **[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** as **Sanchez Fuego** and his tag team partner from their previous wrestling careers
- This recognition leads to a conversation where **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** offers to join their group
- Brings his student **Takitu**, a small assistant who helps manage his affairs

### Ohma's Recruitment

**[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** approaches the party after recognizing their wrestling personas:
- Knows them from their previous careers as luchador wrestlers
- Recognizes them as the wanted criminals from bounty posters
- Offers to help them navigate the sewers safely in exchange for joining their group
- Reveals he knows secret paths and is actually a member of the resistance

## Family Rescue Mission

### Infiltrating the Residential Hall

**[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** enters the building disguised as an elderly visitor:
- Finds **Pinky** (Lark's mother) at bingo night - an elderly dwarf with shock pink hair and sequined clothing
- Discovers the family can move freely but are watched by guards
- Plans an extraction during a planned distraction

### The Fireworks Distraction

**[Bru](/player-characters/bru)** sets up an elaborate fireworks display:
- Uses all his explosives branded with [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna) and Doomfall logos
- **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** ceremonially triggers the detonation as his "initiation"
- **Kevin** ([Bru](/player-characters/bru)'s homunculus) runs through the area screaming "Fire!"
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** uses **Minor Illusion** to enhance the spectacle

The distraction works perfectly - the guards assume it's a legitimate emergency and help evacuate citizens, completely clearing the area around the residential hall.

### Successful Extraction

**[Olivia](/player-characters/olivia)** guides Lark's family (including **Pinky**, two children, and their dog) through the chaos:
- The family includes Lark's mother, brother's wife and children
- They successfully reach the sewer entrance where **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** guides them to safety
- The reunion occurs in the underground tunnels without incident

## Lark's Decision

### The Moment of Truth

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** confronts **Lark** about her ultimate loyalty, recognizing her internal conflict:
- She could betray them to the Iron Claws for rewards
- She could simply flee with her family
- She could join the resistance and fight against Helja

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)'s Persuasion**: In a powerful speech, [Silas](/player-characters/silas) shares his personal experience working for crime bosses like Helja, explaining that no amount of loyalty or service ever creates real security. He urges Lark to take this opportunity to break free permanently.

### Lark's Choice

**Lark** decides to get her family to safety first, then potentially return to help the resistance:
- Gives the party a **+6 bonus item** as thanks for their help
- Takes her family through the escape tunnels toward the city outskirts
- Promises to consider returning once her loved ones are safe
- Leaves on good terms, expressing gratitude for their assistance

## Discovery of the Resistance Headquarters

### Underground Journey

**[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)** leads the party through the complex sewer and cave systems:
- They encounter **two Iron Claws guards** blocking their path
- **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)** successfully uses **Sleep** to incapacitate one guard
- When stealth fails, they use the magical paint to create a wall, trapping the guards

### The Underground Rave

As they approach the resistance headquarters, the party discovers a massive problem:
- **Thousands of teenagers** with **purple eyes** are gathered in an enormous underground nightclub
- The "ravers" are clearly under **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s supernatural influence**
- They're having "the greatest party of all time" right next to the resistance base
- **Persistent bass music** reverberates through the entire underground complex

### Resistance Headquarters

The party finally reaches **Victor's** operation:
- **Victor** is working at a table covered with maps and plans
- Several other resistance members are present
- The headquarters is dangerously exposed to the rave activity
- **Victor** recognizes most of the party but is confused by **[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)'s** presence

## Character Development and Relationships

### Silas's Leadership

**[Silas](/player-characters/silas)** demonstrates significant character growth:
- Takes charge during the infiltration planning
- Shows genuine care for Lark's situation beyond just tactical concerns
- Delivers a persuasive and emotionally honest speech about breaking free from criminal organizations
- Successfully coordinates the team's various deception and stealth efforts

### Ohma's Integration

**[Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) Kapua** proves his worth to the team:
- Demonstrates formidable combat abilities in the wrestling match
- Provides crucial knowledge about underground passages
- Shows he can be trusted with their identities and mission
- Brings useful resistance connections and local expertise

### Helisanna's Uncontrolled Influence

The massive underground rave reveals the extent of **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s** supernatural power:
- Her influence has created a city-wide phenomenon she doesn't control
- Thousands of young people are affected by her musical magic
- The situation poses both opportunities and serious complications for future operations

## Equipment and Resources

### New Acquisitions

- **+6 bonus item** from Lark (unspecified magical item)
- **Wrestling winnings** from [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)'s victory (approximately 200 gold split among betting participants)
- **Fake identity papers** created by [Silas](/player-characters/silas)
- **Magical paint** usage to permanently alter the tunnel system

### Ongoing Assets

- **Hidden garage** created with magical paint, protecting their vehicles
- **New tunnel routes** providing secure access to the city
- **Resistance contact** through [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma) and now direct access to Victor
- **Strong relationship** with Lark despite her departure

## Plot Threads and Implications

### Immediate Concerns

1. **The Underground Rave**: Thousands of [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s influenced followers create both an opportunity and a massive security risk for resistance operations

2. **Victor's Operations**: The resistance headquarters is now accessible, but their proximity to the rave complicates operational security

3. **Iron Claws Response**: The party's infiltration methods (magical walls, obvious fireworks) will likely be investigated

### Strategic Advantages

1. **Tunnel Network**: Permanent new routes provide ongoing access to the city
2. **Resistance Alliance**: Direct connection to Victor's organization
3. **Local Guide**: [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)'s knowledge of the underground systems
4. **Successful Mission**: Proving their competence to potential allies

### Future Complications

1. **[Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s Influence**: The supernatural rave situation needs to be addressed
2. **Bounty Hunters**: Multiple groups are still actively hunting the party
3. **Helja's Response**: The crime boss will likely increase security after the family rescue
4. **Identity Exposure**: Their infiltration methods were fairly obvious despite their success

## Session Themes

This episode expertly balances multiple story elements:

**Infiltration and Espionage**: The party demonstrates growing sophistication in planning and executing covert operations, using magical resources creatively while maintaining operational security.

**Found Family**: Lark's difficult choice between her criminal past and protecting her family resonates with several party members who have made similar decisions.

**Unintended Consequences**: [Helisanna](/player-characters/helisanna)'s supernatural influence continues to create complications even when she's not actively using her powers.

**Team Building**: [Ohma](/player-characters/ohma)'s recruitment showcases how the party can attract capable allies through demonstrated competence and moral clarity.

The session ends with the party having successfully completed their rescue mission while discovering both new opportunities (resistance headquarters) and new challenges (the massive underground rave) that will shape their future adventures in High Forge.
