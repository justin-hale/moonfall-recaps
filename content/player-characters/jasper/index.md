## Background
Jasper Gaines is a human barbarian who joined the party during the winter solstice celebrations in Milstrom.

- **Straightforward**: Prefers direct action over complex schemes or negotiations

## Equipment & Abilities

## Character Development

- **Moral Compass**: Demonstrating that not all Eldoran-connected individuals support the Empire's extremist policies
- **Combat Effectiveness**: Establishing himself as a powerful front-line fighter
- **Community Leadership**: Building relationships and improving Eldoran reputation through heroic actions

## Combat Role
Jasper serves as a primary tank and damage dealer:
- **Front-Line Fighter**: Charges into melee combat using berserker rage for enhanced damage
- **Ranged Options**: Effective with thrown hand axes before closing to melee range
- **Battlefield Mobility**: Uses his barbarian speed and athletics to control positioning
- **Damage Absorption**: High hit points and rage resistance help him protect squishier party members

## Notable Moments

- **Gaines Bakery**: Provides baked goods and food services
- **Gaines Bankery**: Offers financial services (the exact nature of this remains mysterious)
- **VIP Services**: The party has obtained tickets for VIP treatment at his establishments

## Current Goals
- Continue integrating with the party and proving his trustworthiness
- Support the fight against cosmic threats while maintaining his business operations
- Improve relations between moderate Eldoran citizens and resistance communities
- Develop his barbarian abilities and combat effectiveness
- Maintain his friendship with Roscoe and other community connections

## Eldoran Connections
- **Military Background**: His "Lieutenant" title suggests military service or rank
- **Unusual Equipment**: His dull, blackened crystals suggest he may not be in good standing with the Empire
- **Moderate Politics**: Shows none of the religious extremism typical of Eldoran knights
- **Business Independence**: Operates his own enterprises rather than serving direct Imperial interests

## Quirks & Mannerisms
- Immediately trusts and befriends Roscoe despite the warforged's eccentricities
- Prefers action over lengthy discussions or planning
- Shows remarkable skill at coordinating with allies despite being new to the group
- Maintains his business relationships even while adventuring
- Demonstrates surprising tactical awareness for a straightforward barbarian
