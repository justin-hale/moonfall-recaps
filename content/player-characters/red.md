## Background

### Early Life
Red was born as Prince Thurnok Skyhammer but was hidden as an infant when Eldoran Knights attacked his village, killing most warriors and capturing scientists. The **Cross family** (Marion and Robert Cross), followers of Tyr, helped hide him in Milstrom where he was raised as their adopted son.

### The Deception
Red grew up believing he was an orphan taken in by the kind Cross family, unaware of his royal heritage or the cosmic importance of his bloodline until much later in his journey.

### The Spaceship Entity

- **Moral Legacy**: His example of selfless protection continues to influence party decisions

Red's transformation represents one of the campaign's most significant character developments, showing how personal growth and heroic sacrifice can have cosmic-level consequences while exploring the painful costs of destiny and duty.
