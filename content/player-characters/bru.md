## Key Relationships

### Kevin (Homunculus)
His loyal but high-strung mechanical servant who serves as comic relief, scout, and occasional sacrifice for dangerous tasks like bomb defusal.

### Silas Fairbanks
Former partner in crime with a complex relationship built on shared trauma and mutual protection, despite frequent bickering.

### "Bru's Army"
A collection of magical creatures he's recruited:
- Three dimensional-shifting lambs from Jeffrey's farm
- Gus the cliff-climbing ram
- Various other magical creatures attracted to his chaotic energy
- Jeffrey as "upper middle management" and army chef

### Crimson the Cardinal
A mechanical cardinal familiar created as a memorial to Red after his sacrifice, equipped with a jetpack instead of natural flight - representing Bru's way of processing grief through engineering.

### The Party
- **Red (Deceased)**: Created memorial tattoos and Crimson the Cardinal after Red's transformation
- **Olivia**: Recipient of his Propulsion Shield, showing care through practical protection
- **Elspeth**: Engineering partner on advanced projects like the rocket ship and pocket village
- **Helisanna**: Frequent collaborator on performance pyrotechnics

## Signature Traits

### The Brown Obsession
Bru is obsessed with a mysterious drink called "Brown" - described as a chunky, alcoholic beverage that he insists all alcohol should be. He frequently modifies drinks by adding dirt or other substances to make them "brown" and maintains that all Brown is "chewy."

### Explosive Solutions
His go-to solution for most problems involves explosives, fireworks, or fire. This has led to both spectacular successes (clearing avalanche paths during races) and dangerous mishaps. His expertise now extends to precise demolition work for resistance operations.

### Military Leadership
Despite his chaotic nature, he has shown surprising aptitude for organizing and leading his "army" of magical creatures, briefly being declared "elder" of Lakeshore Vale village.

### Technical Genius
Behind the chaos, Bru is genuinely brilliant at magical engineering and has contributed to advanced projects including:
- Rocket ship modifications using violessence crystals
- Pocket village construction (ongoing project)
- Radio interception and communication systems
- Precision explosive placement for maximum effect

## Character Development

### From Chaos to Leadership
While maintaining his chaotic energy, Bru has grown into leadership roles, particularly with his magical creature army and technical projects. His brief stint as village elder shows unexpected capacity for responsibility.

### Processing Grief Through Creation
Red's sacrifice profoundly affected Bru, leading to violent anger at the Goliaths responsible and channeling his grief into creating memorial items. He declared all Goliaths his enemies after Red's transformation.

### Technical Innovation
His inventions have become increasingly sophisticated, from simple fireworks to complex magical devices, theoretical rocket modifications, and precision demolition work for resistance operations.

### Radio Operations
Recently discovered talent for intercepting and participating in resistance communications, recognizing voices and verifying identities through technical knowledge.
