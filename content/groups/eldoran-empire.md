# The Eldoran Empire

## Overview
The Eldoran Empire is a rapidly expanding totalitarian theocracy ruled by Empress Eldora, a mortal who ascended to godhood and now seeks to eliminate all rival deities while establishing absolute dominion over both terrestrial and cosmic realms.

## Campaign Significance
The Eldoran Empire represents the primary antagonistic force driving the campaign's major conflicts. Their systematic expansion, religious persecution, and cosmic-scale ambitions create both immediate threats to individual communities and existential dangers to the fundamental order of reality. The Empire's combination of advanced technology, religious fanaticism, and divine authority makes them a formidable opponent requiring both tactical resistance and strategic alliance-building to overcome.

## Future Implications
- **Escalating Conflict**: Progression from local to cosmic-scale warfare
- **Divine Consequences**: Results of systematic god elimination on universal stability
- **Technological Arms Race**: Resistance groups developing competitive capabilities
- **Dimensional Warfare**: Expansion of conflict across multiple planes of existence
- **Resistance Coordination**: Growing networks of opposition requiring imperial response

The Eldoran Empire's relentless expansion and theological supremacism ensure continued conflict as heroes and resistance movements struggle to preserve freedom, diversity, and the natural cosmic order against imperial domination.
