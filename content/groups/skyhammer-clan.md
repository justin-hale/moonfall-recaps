# Skyhammer Clan

## Overview
The Skyhammer Clan is [Red](/player-characters/red)'s (Thurnok Skyhammer's) ancestral Goliath community, survivors of an Imperial massacre who have rebuilt their civilization with advanced technology in a mountain stronghold atop Grimvar's Spine.

## Leadership

### Elder Ragar
- **Role**: Clan leader and elder
- **Age**: Ancient, even by Goliath standards
- **Responsibilities**: Overseeing the starship construction project and clan governance
- **Knowledge**: Keeper of clan history and the secrets of bloodline-powered technology
- **Personality**: Wise but burdened by the knowledge that their cosmic rebellion depends on [Red](/player-characters/red)'s untested abilities

## Settlement Description

### Location
- **Mountain**: Summit of Grimvar's Spine
- **Elevation**: High altitude requiring specialized equipment and clothing
- **Defenses**: Natural mountain barriers plus technological security systems
- **Accessibility**: Difficult mountain climbing required to reach the settlement

### Technology Level
The Skyhammer settlement represents a unique fusion of advanced technology and environmental harmony:

#### Power Systems
- **Solar Panels**: Extensive solar energy collection arrays
- **Crystal Technology**: White crystal-powered equipment distinct from Eldoran violaceous crystals
- **Electric Infrastructure**: Full electrical lighting and power distribution

#### Construction Materials
- **Aluminum and Steel**: Advanced metallurgy and construction techniques
- **Solarpunk Aesthetic**: Technology integrated harmoniously with mountain environment
- **Sustainable Design**: Environmentally conscious building practices

#### Military Equipment
- **Railguns**: Advanced projectile weapons for clan defense
- **Crystal-Embedded Weapons**: Energy-enhanced armaments
- **Defensive Installations**: Strategic placement of technological defenses

### The Starship Project
The clan's most ambitious undertaking is constructing a spacecraft capable of reaching and potentially destroying Eldora's artificial moon:

#### Current Status
- **Partially Constructed**: The rocket platform dominates the village center
- **Massive Scale**: Large enough to accommodate significant crew and equipment
- **Advanced Design**: Incorporates the clan's most sophisticated technology

#### The Bloodline Problem
- **Power Source**: Only someone of the main Skyhammer bloodline can power the spacecraft
- **Lost Knowledge**: The specific method was known only to [Red](/player-characters/red)'s birth parents
- **The Trials**: [Red](/player-characters/red) must undergo the Worms Tunnel trials to unlock this ability or die in the attempt

## Historical Background

### The Massacre
When [Red](/player-characters/red) was an infant, Eldoran Knights attacked the Skyhammer village:
- **Warrior Losses**: Most of the clan's fighters were killed
- **Intellectual Theft**: Scientists and technological knowledge were captured and taken
- **Royal Escape**: [Red](/player-characters/red)'s parents managed to hide him with the Cross family before being killed
- **Survivor Rebuilding**: The remaining clan members rebuilt in their current mountain location

### The Skyhammer Program
Following the massacre, the survivors developed their cosmic resistance plan:
- **Technological Development**: Advanced their capabilities to space-faring levels
- **Strategic Planning**: Identified Eldora's artificial moon as a critical target
- **Bloodline Research**: Discovered the hereditary power requirements for their technology
- **Long-term Mission**: Preparing for eventual cosmic warfare against the Empire

## Culture and Society

### Technology Integration
The Skyhammer clan has developed a unique culture that balances:
- **Goliath Traditions**: Maintaining their ancestral customs and social structures
- **Technological Advancement**: Embracing sophisticated engineering and scientific methods
- **Environmental Harmony**: Sustainable practices despite advanced technology
- **Military Preparedness**: Constant readiness for Imperial retaliation

### Religious Practices
- **Ancestral Reverence**: Honoring those lost in the massacre
- **Royal Traditions**: Specific ceremonies and trials for the bloodline
- **Cosmic Awareness**: Understanding their role in the broader celestial conflict

## Current Capabilities

### Defensive Strength
- **Mountain Fortress**: Nearly impregnable natural position
- **Advanced Weapons**: Superior to typical medieval-level technology
- **Coordination**: Well-organized military structure
- **Intelligence**: Knowledge of Imperial movements and capabilities

### Scientific Achievement
- **Spacecraft Construction**: Demonstrating engineering capabilities beyond their era
- **Crystal Technology**: Independent development of energy systems
- **Metallurgy**: Advanced materials science and manufacturing
- **Sustainable Systems**: Self-sufficient energy and resource management

## The Worms Tunnel Trials

### Purpose
- **Bloodline Verification**: Proving [Red](/player-characters/red)'s legitimate royal heritage
- **Power Awakening**: Unlocking the hereditary abilities needed to power the starship
- **Knowledge Recovery**: Potentially recovering the lost understanding of bloodline technology
- **Survival Test**: Only true Skyhammer royalty can survive the trials

### The Stakes
- **Success**: [Red](/player-characters/red) gains the ability to power their cosmic rebellion against Eldora
- **Failure**: [Red](/player-characters/red) dies, and the clan loses their only hope of operating the starship
- **Urgency**: Imperial knowledge of [Red](/player-characters/red)'s survival makes time critical

## Relationships with the Party

### Trust and Alliance
- **Compensation**: Ragar has promised rewards for returning their lost prince
- **Mission Alignment**: The clan's goals align with the party's opposition to Imperial expansion
- **Resource Sharing**: Potential access to advanced technology and mountain fortress
- **Strategic Partnership**: Mutual benefit in cosmic-scale conflict

### Concerns
- **[Red](/player-characters/red)'s Inexperience**: Uncertainty about his ability to survive the trials
- **Outside Influence**: Concern about non-Goliath party members' motivations
- **Imperial Threats**: Fear that [Red](/player-characters/red)'s location may be compromised
- **Timeline Pressure**: Urgency to complete trials before Imperial retaliation

## Campaign Significance
The Skyhammer clan represents both [Red](/player-characters/red)'s personal destiny and the broader resistance against Eldoran cosmic dominance. Their advanced technology and strategic position make them crucial allies in the escalating conflict, while [Red](/player-characters/red)'s trials will determine whether the resistance gains the capability to challenge the Empire's space-based supremacy.

## Future Implications
- **Cosmic Warfare**: Potential for space-based battles against Eldoran forces
- **Technology Sharing**: Advanced clan knowledge could benefit the broader resistance
- **Royal Destiny**: [Red](/player-characters/red)'s acceptance or rejection of his heritage will shape his character arc
- **Strategic Alliance**: The clan could become a major base of operations for anti-Imperial activities
